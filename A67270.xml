            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HOw great a Happineſs it is to this weather-beaten Church to have a Perſon of ſo great Abilities, and known Integrity, advanced to that high Honour and Truſt of being its Prime Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in theſe unsteady and tempeſtuous Times, is
<pb facs="tcp:107492:3"/> eaſier by much for me to conceive, than to declare. Nevertheleſs I do humbly aſſume the boldneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the deep ſenſe I have of it, and the high joy I have conceived for it, by dedicating unto Your Graces Name the enſuing Treatiſe: in which I defend that Church, whereof You are conſtituted the Supreme Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter, againſt ſuch a ſort of Adverſaries, as strike not only at its Wealth and Grandeur, but even at its very Life and Being, and most eſpecially in their management of that particular Controverſie, which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theſe following Papers, whereby, whilſt they go about to unchriſten our Perſons, they endeavour to unchurch our Church: for how that can be a true Chriſtian Church, in which there is neither Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor Miniſter, nor People, that have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with a true Chriſtian Baptiſm, (and none have been ſo, in the opinion of the Anabaptiſts, that have not been totally dipped) I am yet to learn. And I humbly beg, that Your Grace will vouchſafe Your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage to this particular Treatiſe, becauſe of the weighty importance of this Controverſie, and of the indiſpenſable neceſſity of making good this Poſt againſt the inſulting Adverſary, and of clearing all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about it, that ſo the unſetled Conſciences of well-meaning men, who modeſtly doubt, or are unfactiouſly diſſatisfied therein, and, as they ſoberly ſeek, ſo would gladly find, whereon they might ſafely, as well as finally ſettle, may at length have ſolid ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build a clear ſatisfaction to themſelves, that they are already in a state of true Chriſtianity, and live in a truly Chriſtian Community, and have no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb facs="tcp:107492:3"/> in order thereunto, of turning Anabaptiſts, and being baptized over again; that ſo every stone of Offence, and Stumbling-block of doubt being removed out of the way, the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> on this account, may chearfully and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly return to union with it; which as it is my hearts wiſh, and ſouls deſire, ſo is it my principal aim, and main deſign in theſe Papers: or elſe may be known to all the World to continue perverſly and unconſcionably in their ſeparation from it; which God, in his infinite mercy to this Church, and Them, forbid. And now, as knowing that Your Graces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are both too many, and too weighty, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or interrupted, with other mens little, and yet long impertinencies, I wiſh Your Grace much joy of, and the Church a long enjoyment of You in, that Honour, whereunto his Majeſty, to the great content of all his People, hath ſo worthily advanced You; and in all dutiful affection remain</p>

               <salute>Courteous READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the midſt of Trouble by the death of my dear Wife, Sickneſs of my ſelf, and Diſſolution of my Family and School, by the Small pox, about the beginning of the Year 1677. came to me one Mr. <hi>Pan</hi> with a <hi>Challenge</hi> to a publick <hi>Diſputation</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Grantham,</hi> a Ring-leader, it ſeems, of the Sect of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> as they are pleaſed now to call themſelves, whom elder times uſed to call <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> This challenge I refuſed to accept of. That <hi>Refuſal</hi> was Trumpeted up and down among their Party, and by them among others, to the diſparagement both of my <hi>Perſon,</hi> and of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> I maintain. With the Refuſal, I ſent the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of it alſo, which they have not been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous as equally to diſperſe; I will therefore beg the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Favour, that I may acquaint him therewith; which done, I ſhall leave both him and all the world, to judge as they pleaſe of me and it. And this Publication of my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> I make by the advice of my Prudent Friends; and I do it partly to give a ſtop to the boaſtings of that Party, and prevent prejudice to my Cauſe on that account, and partly to allay that Pruriency of mind to diſputation, which may be in ſome, by ſhewing them Reaſons why they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb facs="tcp:107492:4"/> Diſputes, unleſs when they are as well <hi>Authorized</hi> to it, as <hi>Enabled</hi> for it. And but for this I could very conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly have ſat down under all my diſparagements, being abundantly ſatisfied with that Approbation of my Refuſal, which I found it to have, in the judgment of Wiſe men. The Reaſons were theſe that follow, all in Subſtance, and much in Words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I alledged my want of a <hi>Memory</hi> neceſſary for ſuch a Purpoſe. He, I ſaid, that was to manage a Publick Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, needed to be a man of a great Memory, able, not only to repeat Syllogiſms, but alſo to quote Chapter and Verſe of Scripture, and Book and Section of other Authors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Occaſions and Scopes of Diſcourſes incident, with their Contexts, Antecedents, and Conſequents. But I was ſo far from all this, that if any thing ſhould be quoted againſt me out of mine own Book, I could hardly be able to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, till I had ſeen, and read the place. And therefore as being utterly unfit in that reſpect for any ſuch undertaking, I refuſed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſaid, He, that was to engage in a Publick Diſpute, ought to be a Perſon of great boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. And 'tis true; for elſe, though otherwiſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently learned and eloquent, he ſhall by ſome inſolencies in the words or carriage of a bold and confident Antagoniſt (or perhaps of ſome of the Company) be daſhed out of countenance, if not quite baffled, and ſilenced; however he ſhall be troubled, and diſturbed, if not utterly confounded, in his own reaſonings; he ſhall loſe many advantages by what he could ſpeak, for want of confidence to ſpeak them; and his <hi>Cauſe</hi> too ſhall ſuffer for his ſake, in the opinion of at leaſt one half of his Hearers, who will conclude the timidity of his <hi>Perſon</hi> to be the product of his own ſenſe of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Cauſe.</hi> But I (as I ſaid) was a man of ſo much Modeſty and diffidence, that if I did but appear in any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Audience, I was ordinarily ſtruck with ſuch a Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I was hardly able to deliver any thing I had to ſay, unleſs I had my Notes before me to read, or caſt my eye
<pb facs="tcp:107492:5"/> upon at pleaſure. And having been all my life long uſed to privacy, and retirement, and never drawn forth into any ſuch publick contraſt, I could not think I could be able to keep courage and countenance, and manage my undertaking with that boldneſs and confidence, which was neceſſary on ſuch occaſion, and in the preſence of ſo vaſt a multitude, as would have been gathered together to hear us. And if my Memory was bad of it ſelf, that <hi>Fear</hi> would have made it worſe. And even the conſcience of a bad Memory was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, even of it ſelf, to diffuſe a diffidence into me, had I been otherwiſe indued with a better ſtock of Confidence, than I dare boaſt my ſelf to have. And ſo, as utterly unfit on that account alſo to maintain a Publick Diſputation, I declined it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I alledged my ſelf utterly unqualified for ſuch an undertaking, if not by reaſon of <hi>Sorrow of Mind,</hi> yet on account of <hi>Infirmity of Body.</hi> He, I ſaid, that was to manage a Publick Diſpute ought to be a man of a ſtrong Body, and ſound Lungs, able to ſpeak long, and loud, that the Auditors might underſtand what was ſaid, and eſpecially ſince the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour now was to give the Cauſe, not according to the <hi>Soundneſs of the Reaſon,</hi> but according to the <hi>Loudneſs of the Voice</hi> of the Diſputant. But I was a man far from this, being at preſent but in a <hi>recovering condition</hi> from two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, juſt got down out of my Chamber, not as yet got abroad, and at beſt ſubject to Infirmities enough, to procure me, from any man of Reaſon or Pity, a Writ of Eaſe from ſuch an endangering Engagement. Should I have appointed a day for Diſpute, I could not be ſure I ſhould be able to hold it, going many times well to bed, and being arreſted ere the morning with the Stone or the Gout. And what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation would have been made upon a faileur on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, though the reaſon had been never ſo juſt; and how much it muſt have been turned to the diſparagement not of my <hi>Perſon</hi> only, but of my <hi>Cauſe</hi> too, let the Reader judge. And ſuppoſing it, that I had ſtood ſound in theſe reſpects, yet that I ſhould be able with a Cough of the Lungs, and a
<pb facs="tcp:107492:5"/> broken Vein, to ſpeak ſo loud as to be heard by half the Company, and ſo long as till his <hi>Eight Queſtions</hi> were diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thorough, is not imaginable. And if nothing elſe, yet that neceſſary care that I ought to have of my own preſervation, for the ſake of my children, new made Orphans by the death of their Mother, had reaſon enough in it to diſſwade me from being ſo prodigal of my Life or Health, as, without greater Reaſon, and more Neceſſity for it, than any I yet ſaw, to throw away, or expoſe either unto hazard, in a brabling conteſt; and on that account alſo I would not admit of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſuppoſing nothing of all this had been, yet the buſineſs it ſelf, I ſaid, was of a mighty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not my private quarrel, but the <hi>Churches Cauſe;</hi> and that conſidering my own manifold deficiencies, I could not think my ſelf Champion enough for ſuch an Engagement. And therefore as being unwilling either that ſo great a weight ſhould lie on ſo weak a ſhoulder, or that the Churches Cauſe ſhould ſuffer by my inſufficiency to maintain it, I would not diſpute. It was excepted, I might take in others to my aſſiſtance, and ſo engage with an equal number on the other ſide. To this I replied, that I knew what I had to ſay my ſelf; but what another might ſay I could not tell. And therefore being unwilling to hazard ſo great a concern on ſuch an uncertainty, I would not engage, no not with the aſſiſtance of any other, in a Publick Diſpute. I added alſo that a plurality of Diſputants was many times a hindrance in the diſputation; whilſt one by an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpoſition prevented another of, or put him by, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or diſturbed and confounded him in his Arguing. I ſaid further that I had <hi>written</hi> what I had to ſay in the Cauſe, and Mr. <hi>Grantham,</hi> if he pleaſed, might anſwer that; and then it might by others be judged on which ſide the greateſt probability of truth did lie. It was again excepted, that I might as well <hi>diſpute,</hi> as write. But I anſwered, Nay; for beſides my Perſonal indiſpoſitions rendring me unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Diſputation, when I wrote I could at my beſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſider what I did, and by the help of Books or Notes
<pb facs="tcp:107492:6"/> recover, at one time or other, what was ſlipt out of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; alſo I could offer what I had written to the Eyes of learned Perſons, and have their judgments thereon: but could not do ſo in an Oral Diſputation. It was laſtly urged that my Refuſal to diſpute would <hi>reflect</hi> upon me. But thereto I anſwered, that I would rather chuſe to ſuffer in my Credit for my Refuſing to diſpute, than that the Church ſhould ſuffer in her Cauſe by my ill diſputing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Suppoſing my ſelf never ſo able to diſpute, yet ſtill I alledged, that I had no <hi>warrantable Call</hi> to engage in ſuch a Publick Diſputation. Had the King, or the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or any of my Superiors <hi>commanded</hi> me to it, I muſt have obeyed, and would have done my beſt in it, not doubting but that God that gave me the Call, would alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me his Aſſiſtance. But having no <hi>warrantable Call</hi> thereto, I would not <hi>unwarrantably</hi> engage therein. It was excepted, that I might eaſily obtain leave of the Biſhop, if I would deſire it. But I anſwered, that being neither perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fit for it, nor at all ambitious of it, I would not in the leaſt ſeek after it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I alledged that I had ſeldom known any <hi>great good</hi> that came to the Church by Publick Diſputations. For the Diſputants honour and credit lying at ſtake, <hi>Victory</hi> was more often aimed at than <hi>Truth.</hi> And in order to the obtaining of that, all advantages were by each Antagoniſt againſt his Adverſary narrowly watcht and catcht at; all arts and ſtrategems made uſe of to elude and evade Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (eſpecially when they were likely to prove ſharp and pinching;) and particularly that <hi>notorious one</hi> of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by perverſe and intricating arguings, and croſs and involved anſwerings, if not alſo by ſome exaſperating words, or diſobliging actions, to put the Antagoniſt beſides his Reaſon, by putting him into Paſſion: ſo that ſeldom any Argument was driven to the head, or the Conference came to any good iſſue: but the Diſpute moſtly ended in imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ſquable and endleſs contradiction, to no advantage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſtabliſhment of the truth, or edification of the
<pb facs="tcp:107492:6"/> Hearers: and therefore, were I never ſo able, I ſhould be moſt unwilling, to engage in ſuch a fruitleſs adventure.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I asked, to whoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage</hi> we ſhould ſtand, if we diſputed, as believing it vain to diſpute without an Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. It was anſwered the <hi>Company</hi> ſhould be Judges. I replied, that I was leaſt of all ſatisfied with that: in regard the Hearers, which would be ſure to be of different Parties, uſually judged as they were affected, and ran away, after all, with ſeveral ſtories of what was ſaid and done; and placed the Crown of Victory on the head of their own Combatant; the conſequent whereof was the filling of the Country with confuſed noiſes, and news of their triumphs, not at all tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good of the Church, but to the further unſetling of People in their minds and judgments, and to the diſpoſing of them ſo much the more to Schiſm and Faction. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account alſo, had I been never ſo able, I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſpute. I added alſo, that neither I, nor any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> could engage with any of their Party in a Publick Diſpute, but upon <hi>mighty diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi> For <hi>we,</hi> though never ſo ignorant, muſt be looked upon as great Scholars, and <hi>they,</hi> though never ſo learned, muſt be looked upon as ignorant Men. And then what comes of it? If <hi>we</hi> get the better of them, it is no diſparagement to their Perſons, nor diſadvantage to their Cauſe: becauſe <hi>we</hi> are ſuppoſed to carry the day, not by the goodneſs of our Cauſe, but by the greatneſs of our Learning, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by our cunning and ſophiſtry in diſputing. And, a great piece of matter will it be ſaid to be, for ſuch learned Univerſity Scholars, to be too hard for ſuch unlearned Country Men. But if <hi>they</hi> get the better of <hi>us,</hi> or be but able, though by meer wrangle, to hold us up, then a Song of Triumph is ſung, then both <hi>our Perſons,</hi> and <hi>our Cauſe</hi> ſuffers diſparagement thereby, but <hi>theirs</hi> is ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively magnified by all the Parties and Favourers of their Sect. And that Victory ſhall be ſolely imputed to the <hi>strength of their Cauſe,</hi> which was only owed to the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Adverſary.</hi> And therefore to give them no
<pb facs="tcp:107492:7"/> ſuch matter for Triumph over the Cauſe I maintained, I would not ſo diſadvantagiouſly engage in the Diſpute where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I was challenged.</p>
            <p>And now having declared the Grounds of my Refuſal of that Diſpute, I leave my Self to the Cenſure of all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did as became me, in refuſing it, or not.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I declared to Mr. <hi>Pan</hi> then, that as I had formerly held private Conferences with ſeveral Perſons of their way, naming ſome unto him, ſo if either Himſelf then, or at any other time after, or Mr. <hi>Grantham,</hi> or any other of his Party whatſoever, without excepting any, would come ſingly, and one to one hold diſcourſe with me, in a modeſt way, and a peaceable manner, in order to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his private doubts, he might freely come when he would; I would refuſe none.</p>
            <p>But as that was then refuſed by Mr. <hi>Pan,</hi> ſaying, he came not upon that deſign, ſo neither He, nor any other of their Party hath ever been with me ſince upon any ſuch occaſion. And ſince I find ſo ill uſe made of what paſſed betwixt him and me then, I have cauſe to think it a mercy, that I have been troubled with no more of them; and for the future ſhall ſo think it. I mean the bold <hi>Diſputers</hi> of the Faction, and not any modeſt <hi>doubters</hi> of that way.</p>
            <p>Having for my own, and others ſatisfaction made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſearches into this <hi>difficult Point,</hi> and having at length ſetled upon, as I then thought, and ſtill hope they will prove to be, ſolid grounds of ſatisfaction, and finding this to be <hi>one of the Queſtions,</hi> whereabout Mr. <hi>Grantham</hi> challenged me to diſpute, and remembring what I had heard of his <hi>Abilities</hi> that way, I began with more earneſtneſs of deſire, and firmneſs of reſolution, to purſue my deſign. So that if I have done the Church any ſervice in this Treatiſe, that Challenge of Mr. <hi>Granthams</hi> is in a good meaſure to have the thanks for it: Perhaps elſe it had longer been in doing. And now, having through God's aſſiſtance brought it to an end, I have publiſhed it for the <hi>Common good;</hi> hoping it may in ſome meaſure be uſeful to inform the ignorant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb facs="tcp:107492:7"/> the doubtful, and ſilence at leaſt, if not ſatisfie Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</p>
            <p>I need not, to invite you to the Reading of it, make any long harangue about the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, or its <hi>concernment</hi> to your ſelf. 'Tis in ſhort, no more, nor other, than this, whether you have been truly baptized, and ſo may go on with a ſatisfied conſcience to reckon your ſelf to be a Chriſtian, or whether your former Baptiſm, if not by a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> were not a meer nullity, and you conſequently of neceſſity to be by a new baptiſm, and that too by a <hi>total</hi> Dipping, initiated into a ſtate of Chriſtianity. If I have contributed any thing to your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this ſo <hi>highly,</hi> and ſo <hi>nearly</hi> concerning an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, bleſs God that made me Inſtrumental thereunto. If I come ſhort of my aim therein, then pray to God to put it into the hearts of thoſe that guide the Helm of Church affairs, to preſs <hi>ſome other</hi> more able Perſon for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And the rather ſhould both you and I deſire this, leſt, if we cannot prove our Baptiſm true, we be not able to prove our Chriſtianity good; and if we cannot make good our Chriſtianity, it be not hard for us to prove, either that there is ſuch a thing as a <hi>Miniſtery</hi> in the Church, or ſuch a thing as a <hi>Church</hi> in the Land, unleſs in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> For a Church conſiſting of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and Miniſters, and People, which are all unbaptized Perſons, (as all are by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſo accounted, who were not, when baptized, <hi>totally</hi> dipped) is ſuch a Riddle, as may not very eaſily be reſolved. <hi>Let the wiſe in heart conſider this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſaid enough, if not too much, by way of <hi>Preface;</hi> and therefore I will not detain you any longer with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of my Phraſe, Style, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling of this Subject,<note n="*" place="margin">Only note, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I uſe <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> as a generical word, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all the ways of baptizing different from <hi>Dipping.</hi>
               </note> but leave that to the judgment of your own candor and ingenuity, hoping that what is given you with the right hand, you will not take with the left. Farewell.</p>

               <hi>O</hi> Lord God, who hast given me power, and will, leiſure and opportunity, to begin, go on with, and finiſh this Treatiſe, I bleſs Thee for all the gracious furtherances, and favourable aſſiſtances vouchſafed unto me therein. And I do most humbly, and most earneſtly beg of Thee to bleſs it to the Ends whereunto I have deſigned it, which are the Advancement of thy Glory, and the promoting of the Peace of this Church, by the Satisfaction of Doubters, and the Conviction of Oppoſers. Put, I beſeech Thee, into the hearts of all that ſhall read it, a readineſs to receive the Truth in Love. And ſecond the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it with ſuch Light and Evidence from thy Word and Spirit, that the Truths herein delivered may be convincingly diſcovered. If to Thy Foundation, which is ever Truth, I have through Ignorance, Inadvertency, or Miſapprehenſion, added any thing that is Erroneous, O let that Error be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that no Other may be deceived thereby, though I have been ſo. And when that Error comes to be juſtly condemned; O let thy Servant be mercifully pardoned. Grant this for Jeſus Christ's ſake. Amen.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107492:10"/> which he had formerly given to his Apoſtles, to preach to the Jews, and baptize them, to an authorizing of them to preach to the Gentiles alſo, and to baptize them; and perhaps with ſome, <hi>Improvement</hi> of it in point of Form, End, or Uſe: whence ſome as well formerly as lately, have been apt to think them the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſm, eſpecially as Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. That by his Apoſtles preaching and baptizing, in purſuance of their Commiſſion, both Jews and Gentiles were at firſt brought to be, and were made Diſciples unto Chriſt, I think is a thing on all hands concluded; as alſo what is meant by Preaching.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. But what is meant by Baptizing, or after what manner Baptiſm was, and is to be adminiſtred, is not ſo well agreed upon.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Some are of opinion that it was, and ought to be performed by a total Immerſion, or Dipping of the whole Perſon into the Water; that this is the only lawful, and effectual way of baptizing, and conſequently of abſolute Neceſſity; and that all other ways are not only unlawful, but perfect nullities.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. But the opinion of others is, that it was, and may be performed otherwiſe than ſo; <hi>viz.</hi> either by Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of ſome Principal part of the Perſon (as the Head or Face,<note place="margin">Aliter pectus credentis abluitur, aliter mens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis per fidei merita mundatur, <hi>D.

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) into the water; or elſe by Pouring or Sprinkling of water upon ſome Principal part of him; that though Immerſion be <hi>a lawful</hi> and an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way of baptizing, yet it is <hi>not the only lawful</hi> and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way of doing it, nor abſolutely neceſſary; but that the other uſual ways of baptizing are lawful alſo as well as it, and the baptiſm adminiſtred by them, to all intents and purpoſes as valid and effectual, as if performed by it.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Immerſion, or Dipping, ſtands on three grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Signification</hi> of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs</hi> of Dipping with the <hi>Nature</hi> of Baptiſm; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107492:10"/> the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Church to Dip when ſhe baptized. Now if it can be ſhewn, that the other uſual ways of baptizing are neither repugnant to the <hi>Signification</hi> of that word; nor to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing; nor to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Church, but are agreeable unto all: then, I hope, it will appear, that they ſtanding on the ſame grounds with Dipping, are alſo lawful as well as Dipping; and that baptiſm by dipping is not ſo neceſſary, as to nullifie the other ways of baptizing, or render them unlawful: And the declaring of this is the deſign of theſe Papers: and that declaration will be a competent expoſition of our Saviours meaning in this his Commiſſion, given to his Apoſtles to make all Nations Diſciples, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">§. 1. THe Method of this Diſcourſe, as it is already laid down, obliges me to begin with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whoſe Participle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here made uſe of by our Saviour. And as it ſtands in this Text it may deſerve an enquiry in what acception, whether Proper or Tropical, it is to be taken: for be the proper acception of it what it will, if it be not here taken in that proper acception, no argument can hence be drawn to infer a neceſſity of dipping.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> to baptize, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed in Scripture according to its literal import, but ſometimes in a Tropical ſenſe, is I think out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. But if any doubt the truth of this point, 'tis eaſily demonſtrated; and an inſtance or two may ſuffice to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107492:11"/>§. 3. And that it is uſed ſometimes in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> ſenſe is apparent by what the Author of the Acts of the Apoſtles reports our Saviour, after his Reſurrection, to have promiſed to his Diſciples, namely, that whereas <hi>John</hi> had <hi>baptized with water, they ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many days after, Act.</hi> 1.5. Where when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> no man that is right in his wits, will ſay he uſed the word baptize in its proper ſenſe, but only in a Metaphorical one; as intimating thereby that within a ſhort ſpace they ſhould be endued with the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe effuſion on them in a larger meaſure, might ſeem to be a kind of baptiſm, the graces of it falling upon them, as the dew fell upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were baptized in the Cloud, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. So when in <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. our Saviour ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed!</hi> he cannot be underſtood to ſpeak of baptiſm in its proper notion. For with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per baptiſm he had already long before been baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi> His meaning then in ſo ſaying, was nothing elſe, but to expreſs by a Metaphorical word, that <hi>grievous afflictions,</hi> thoſe heavy ſufferings of the Croſs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sanguinis inquit proprii tinctione prius habeo perfundi.</hi> Bed. in Luc. Evang. c. 12. v. 50.</note> were ſhortly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by him, whereby he ſhould be as it were overwhelmed, as a man is with waters, when he is baptized by dipping, or rather be bedewed all over with drops of bloud through his ſcourging, or at his bloudy ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a man is bedewed with water; that is baptized by Sprinkling.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. But the word is not uſed in a Metaphorical ſenſe only, but alſo in a Metonymical. And ſo one is ſaid in Scripture to be baptized, who is imbued with, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Doctrine of any Maſter, who initiates his Diſciples with the Ceremony of Baptiſm. Hence <hi>Paul (Act.</hi> 19.3.) asks ſome Diſciples found by him at <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107492:11"/> who had ſaid, that <hi>they had not ſo much as heard, whether there were any Holy Ghoſt, into what they had been baptized,</hi> whereto they anſwered, <hi>into Johns baptiſm.</hi> The ſenſe of which words is, as if the Apoſtle had asked, with what Doctrine they had been inſtructed, and they had anſwered, that they had been inſtructed in that doctrine, which <hi>John</hi> taught. Whence, as it follows (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>John verily baptized with the Baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the people, that they ſhould believe on him, which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Which is, as if it had been ſaid, that <hi>John</hi> had inſtructed the people in the doctrine of repentance, and of faith in Chriſt, who was to come after him. In this ſenſe S. <hi>Mark</hi> (c. 1. v. 4.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports how <hi>John did baptize in the wilderneſs, and preach the baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> that is, inſtruct the people, who were to be baptized, in the doctrine of repentance. And in the ſame manner is <hi>Apollos</hi> by S. <hi>Luke</hi> reported (<hi>Acts</hi> 18.25.) to have <hi>diligently taught the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptiſm of John,</hi> that is, being only inſtructed with that doctrine concerning Chriſt, wherewith <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did imbue and ſeaſon his Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. And there are that earneſtly contend,<note place="margin">Vid. Chriſtian. Beckman. Exercitat. Theolog. <hi>17. p. 257,</hi> &amp;c.</note> that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in this Text, is to be taken, not in the proper, but in this Metonymical ſenſe. And aſſuredly there is <hi>no mention</hi> here (as there is in other places where the word is properly taken) <hi>of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> wherewith the Nations were to be baptized, but only of the Faith wherein they were to be inſtructed.

               <p n="5">§. 5. And yet, before I leave them, give me leave to make one Remark upon their different renderings of the word.

If
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107492:14"/> the former, why ſo many of them uſed, not only ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by all ſeverally, but even together, by one ſingly, viz. <hi>Suidas?</hi> If the latter (which will appear to be true by a conſultation both with Authors and Lexicographers) then they all do not ſignifie a total immerſion. And that's the thing that does our buſineſs. For if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie any thing leſs than a total immerſion, or any thing elſe but that, then a Baptiſm may be, where one is not totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. I will not now ſtand upon it to examine the exact differences of all theſe words one from another: but ſhall only take notice of <hi>tingo,</hi> or as ſome read it, of <hi>tinguo;</hi> becauſe <hi>Martinius,</hi> having ſaid of <gap reason="foreign">

It cannot be thought any of them would do more than (it were ſcarce good breeding to do ſo much as) with a finger or two and a thumb to take ſome part out of it.

               <p n="5">§. 5. Perhaps it may be anſwered that the <hi>dipping</hi> was not into the blood alone, but mixt with running water contained within that earthen Veſſel in which the Bird was commanded to be killed.</p>

The words are, <hi>And when they ſaw ſome of his Diſciples eat bread with defiled (that is to ſay with unwaſhen) hands, they found fault. For the Phariſees and all the Jews, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they waſh their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the Elders. And when they come from the market, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they waſh, they eat not.</hi> The eating here ſpoken of is to be underſtood of common food: for it is ſaid <hi>they eat not,</hi> that is not at all, not ſo much as ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon food, except they waſh.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that, I conceive, is, (ſomewhat otherwiſe than it is ordinarily rendered) up <hi>to the hand-wriſt,</hi> or joyning of the hand to the arm.

And there was no ſuch thing required of them, or uſed by them, as wholly to <hi>immerſe themſelves</hi> in water, in order to the fitting of themſelves for the eating of ſuch a meal. And what pollution had made them unfit for ſuch a meal without a total dipping

For when St. <hi>Peter</hi> reported to the Brethren in <hi>Judaea,</hi> what had befallen <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Holy Ghoſts</hi> being communicated unto thoſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as to themſelves who were <hi>Jews,</hi> (which communication is alſo called <hi>a pouring out of</hi> the gift of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.45.) he ſaith that as he began to ſpeak to them, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

His dipping was not a total immerſion. No more was it neceſſary ſo to be in the waſhing, and even merſation of theſe things. If they were any more than rinſed, yet hardly were they totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed. And to render it probable, we read that the <hi>cup
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107492:29"/> of bleſſing</hi> was but to be dipped on <hi>the outſide,</hi> the inſide rinſed.<note place="margin">Pocock, <hi>Porta Moſ.</hi> p. 404.</note> But if it muſt have been totally <hi>immerſed,</hi> then inſide and outſide and all muſt have been waſhed together, and that by merſation. And would they obſerve more ſtrictneſs in the daily waſhings of every Pot and Cup, as oft as need was, than of that <hi>cup of bleſſing,</hi> which they employed as a Sacred Utenſil in their giving of thanks to God after meat, and for whoſe waſhing they had a particular Tradition? He muſt be very ſanguine, that can believe any ſuch thing. And however that their cleanſing of their Cups and Platters was but partial, and did not extend to the whole, as it muſt have been had their waſhing been by a total immerſion, ſeems apparent by our Saviours alluſion to that cuſtom of theirs (in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25.) where he tells them of their cleanſing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the outſide of the cup and platter.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. And what? would nothing leſs than immerſion, and that a total one, ſerve for the waſhing of their braſen veſſels, and thoſe not all <hi>ſmall ones:</hi> but ſo big,<note place="margin">Pocock, <hi>Porta Moſ.</hi> p. 406.</note> ſome of them, that they held water, for the cleanſing of other veſſels by water poured out thence; nay, and the veſſels themſelves too, fitted for that purpoſe by the wideneſs of their mouths?</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. And muſt the <hi>Tables</hi> too, (or <hi>beds</hi> rather) be cleanſed by merſation? and nothing leſs than a total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be ſufficient for their cleanſing? How difficult if at all practicable, is this, to dip <hi>whole tables,</hi> (or what is worſe, <hi>whole beds</hi>) not untaken in pieces, and wholly into the water? And how troubleſom, and chargeable too, to be always taking them in pieces in order to be dipt, as oft as they might hap to be defiled? and that (ſo many ways were there of their defilement) might happen to be very often.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. And ſuppoſe we render it <hi>dipping,</hi> or by <hi>waſhing</hi> to underſtand ſuch a waſhing as was performed by <hi>dipping:</hi> what? will nothing leſs than a total immerſion of every
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107492:30"/> thing ſerve to name it <hi>dipped?</hi> muſt there be a total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or elſe no dipping? The Prieſt, when a Sin-offering was to be offered (<hi>Lev.</hi> 4.6.17.) was to <hi>dip his finger</hi> in the blood of the Bullock and ſprinkle it. Could nothing ſerve here for the performance of his duty, but the <hi>dipping of his whole finger</hi> into the blood? muſt it all in? no part remain undipped? It is not ſo ſaid. It might truly be ſaid, he <hi>dipped his finger</hi> into it, if ſome <hi>part of his finger</hi> were but dipped therein; if he did but take ſome of the blood with his finger to <hi>ſprinkle,</hi> as it is after in the ſame chapter ſaid he ſhould do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 30, 34.</note> to put upon the horns of the altar.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. But to make this more plain; It is ſaid in <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. that for the cleanſing of a <hi>Leper,</hi> the Prieſt ſhould take ſome of a log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand, and ſhould <hi>dip his right finger</hi> in the oil, that was in his left hand, and ſhould ſprinkle of the oil with his finger ſeven times. I would fain know how a man ſhould hold in the <hi>palm of his hand</hi> (for ſo is the word, and not the <hi>hollow of his fiſt</hi>) ſo much oil as ſhould be ſufficient <hi>to dip</hi> all his whole finger (in the ſenſe that our <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> do underſtand <hi>dipping</hi>) in it. The improbability, or rather impoſſibility of which the LXX. diſcerning render the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He ſhall</hi> (not dip his finger into, but) <hi>die,</hi> or <hi>wet his finger</hi> with the oil; that is the dipping, and all the dipping they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this place. And yet if that could not be, ſtill his finger might be ſaid to be dipped in it, though it were not all at once immerſed into it, or though ſome part of it, after all, remained undipped. So then theſe waſhings here, ſuppoſe we grant them to be performed by merſation, might intend ſomething leſs than a total immerſion: and then ſtill no neceſſity of interpreting the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in that ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. Another is <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. where the Apoſtle enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the ſeveral ſorts of external ordinances, beſides
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107492:30"/> Gifts and Sacrifices, which were impoſed on the People of the Jews during that <hi>Levitical Oeconomy,</hi> that they were to be exerciſed under, until the time of reformation, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>divers waſhings.</hi> Now unleſs thoſe waſhings here intended were all immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and total ones too, it cannot be avoided, but that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the only word here uſed to comprehend all thoſe divers waſhings, is capable of ſignifying other ways of waſhing, than by a total immerſion: and ſo cannot by the force of its ſignification compel us always to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand baptiſm to mean a total immerſion, &amp; to conclude that waſhing, which is not by ſuch immerſion, to be no baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Now that theſe baptiſms were not all immerſions, may appear from the conſideration of ſeveral <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> appointed to be waſhed. There were three ſorts of Perſons amongſt the Iſraelites that were to be waſhed: the Prieſts, the Levites, and the People after any pollution contracted upon them. Now if we conſult <hi>the bare words of truth,</hi> we ſhall find, upon examination, all theſe ſorts of Perſons waſhed, and yet not neceſſarily always by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion of their whole body, at leaſt as far as appears by Text of Scripture, ungloſſed by Rabbinical Traditions, and unſenſed with Anabaptiſtical Interpretations.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. Firſt the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> of all other, as being the moſt holy, one would think ſhould have been dipped, if that in the eſteem of God were a higher degree of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than other ways of waſhing, and eſpecially at their conſecration to holy Orders. And yet no ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of them. Their Conſecration is appointed in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 29. Of the order whereof, as God gives it unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> part was their waſhing. That is preſcribed in the fourth Verſe. But now? By dipping! Not a word of that there. How then? Hear, what God ſays. <hi>And Aaron and his Sons ſhalt thou bring unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt waſh them with water.</hi>

                  </gap>: and that they do not univerſally ſignifie a total immerſion.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. BUT perhaps it will be ſaid, that our Saviour did not deliver his mind in <hi>Greek.</hi> In what Language then? In <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Syriac,</hi> doubtleſs: but in whether 'tis hard to ſay. But what then? what? why then, though <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, either in its own native import, or in the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical</hi> uſe of it, might ſignifie not always a <hi>total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but ſometimes ſomething leſs than that, even an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> or <hi>aſperſion</hi> of water, yet it is not to be taken here, ſo as to ſignifie any thing leſs than that word did, wherein our Saviour deliver'd his mind: and if that ſignified only a <hi>total</hi> immerſion, then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, what ever it may ſignifie in it ſelf, ought with us to ſignifie nothing leſs than ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. To this I anſwer firſt, that it being not certainly known in what Language our Saviour ſpake, when he gave the order for baptizing, the Language, that he ſpake in, ought not to be urged in this caſe, ſo as to preſcribe to the uſe of the word, that we have his mind delivered in unto us. Tell us exactly the particular word that he ſpake, and what was the exact ſignification of that word, and, unleſs we can ſhew a reaſon for a diſpenſation, we will do what that word requireth of us.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Secondly the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which excited St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> to write his Goſpel, and aſſiſted him in the writing of it, knew his mind, and ſuggeſted to his <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſuch a word, as was expreſſive of his mind: and what that word doth import, that we take to be his mind,<note place="margin">That paſſage in Tilenus, Alioqui Apoſtolis, <hi>Syro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> idiomate, quo vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet Chriſtus uſus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, utendum fuiſſet, (Diſp. <hi>1.</hi> de Bapt. Theſ. <hi>17.) ſhews he thought that</hi> Syriac <hi>was the Language our Saviour ſpake.</hi>
                  </note> and the very thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by his word, in what Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſoever he ſpake, whether <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:107492:36"/> or <hi>Syriac.</hi> And ſo, for as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word dictated by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as we ſuppoſe, to the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,</hi> admits of a <hi>latitude,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>Sacred Authors,</hi> if not in profane alſo, ſo as to ſignifie other ways of <hi>baptizing,</hi> than by a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> therefore we are to underſtand, that the word he delivered his mind in, were it <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriac,</hi> was alſo of the ſame import. And ſo we are where we were ſtill.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But ſuppoſe he ſpake <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Syriac,</hi> What are the words he muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſpoken in this caſe? It will be ſaid, if <hi>Hebrew,</hi>

                  </note> Here is but ſuppoſition all this while, and no proof: unleſs thoſe Languages afforded no other words to expreſs waſhing, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that kind of waſhing, which was uſed as the <hi>ceremony for initiation of Diſciples</hi> under the Diſcipline of a Maſter.

Yet ſuppoſe we join iſſues, and take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the one, or the other, of theſe words, was the word that our Saviour delivered his mind in, and that proportionably to the import of that word we are to underſtand the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> muſt ſignifie a <hi>total immerſion?</hi> I hope not. If they do not neceſſarily ſignifie ſo much, then cannot <gap reason="foreign">

In <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.22. order is given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at the inſtitution of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> firſt to kill a Lamb, and then to take a bunch of Hyſſop, and <hi>dip it in the blood of it,</hi> and ſtrike the Lintel, and the two ſide-Poſts therewith. Now what Man of reaſon would ever think any more intended by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that he that took the Hyſſop, as he held one end of the bunch in his hand, ſo he ſhould <hi>dip</hi> the other end of it into the blood? Which of us being to act the ſame thing, and having no further directions than they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have had, would do any more than ſo? And who would not think the order exactly fulfilled in ſo doing? Who would ever dream of a neceſſity of <hi>immerſing</hi> the whole bunch into the blood? or fancy it was not dipt at all, becauſe not all dipt? Let us conſult our reaſons, and think like Men, and we cannot imagine any more than a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107492:37"/> partial merſation of the bunch into the blood (<hi>viz.</hi> the buſhie end of it) to have been intended by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or practiſed by <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And then here will be one inſtance of this word's ſignifying leſs than a total dipping of that, which yet is ſaid to be dipped.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. And, the more to confirm it, we may note, (and it is obſervable) that the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> of this place, though they uſe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="9">§. 9. But if this inſtance be not clear enough and full enough (as to any reaſonable and modeſt Inquirer it may ſeem to be) there is another that probably is. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. we have the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s being ſold to the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> by his Brethren. Part of that ſtory is their contriving how to blind their Father, and make him believe his Son was torn in pieces by ſome evil Beaſt. In order unto that they <hi>kill a Kid,</hi> and <hi>beſmear</hi> the <hi>Coat</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> thereof. We cannot imagine that the <hi>Coat was bebloodied all over,</hi> as it muſt have been, if it had been <hi>totally immerſed</hi> into blood. Nor would the crafty Brethren do ſo with it: for their fraud could not poſſibly, had they ſo done, have eſcaped diſcovery by their prudent Father. <hi>So much</hi> of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only was <hi>beſmeared with blood,</hi> as might make it look like the Coat of one ſlain by a wild Beaſt, which would here <hi>be bloody,</hi> and there be without any tincture of blood, as the iſſues from the wounds ſhould diſperſe the tinctures, and not be bloody all over, like a Veſture dipt in blood. No total immerſion then of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coat into the blood of the Kid, (if the blood of it ſaved at beſt advantage
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107492:38"/> could be ſo much, as that the coat of a perſon ſo old, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> then was, might be totally immerſed into it:) there was but a <hi>beſmearing</hi> of it, at moſt, by a partial merſation only into it. And accordingly the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it by <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">§. 3. Secondly, if our Saviour had deſigned ſtrictly that way of a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> uſed in the time and place when and where he ſpake theſe words, he could have uſed words of a leſſer latitude than <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and which could not be capable of ſignifying any other way of baptizing, ſhort of, or leſs than a total immerſion: Such as <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">§. 4. Thirdly, if our Saviour had deſigned the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this Sacrament only in that Nation, it had been reaſonable to conceive his meaning was, that in the adminiſtration of it the cuſtom of that nation ſhould be obſerved, not only becauſe it would well agree with the temperature of that country, but alſo becauſe the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marineſs of it to another, yet very near, almoſt the ſame purpoſe, would make the reception of it unto his purpoſe the more eaſie to that people.

And according to what in reaſon we believe his real intendment to have been, in reaſon we are to underſtand his word to be meant. And then that muſt be not univerſally of a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> but ſometimes of <hi>other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107492:40"/> ways of baptizing:</hi> becauſe thoſe other ways are more agreeable to the temperature of ſome countries, than that is, and their receptions leſs liable to exception than that would have been.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Fourthly, if our Saviour had deſigned this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be adminiſtred only to perſons of <hi>ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and in healthful ſtate, then in reaſon it might be believed, he intended its adminiſtration only in that way, which was in uſe in that Nation, and at that time, and was but ſuch as perſons in health and ſtrength might without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endure, and without fear undergo. But ſeeing he intended it as an univerſal door for the letting in perſons of all eſtates, conditions, and conſtitutions, as well as Countries, into his Church (for he makes no <hi>limitation</hi> in that caſe, and the Churches practice hath ſo interpreted his precept) therefore it is moſt reaſonable to believe, he would, and did, deſign it ſo wide, as that it might give entrance unto all, and not by the ſtraitneſs of its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and dangerouſneſs to the health and life of perſons of ſick, or ſickly, and weak condition and conſtitution, exclude any, eſpecially in <hi>cold ſeaſons</hi> and climates, and before the uſe of Fonts, when there were only rivers, or pools to baptize in. But that could not be by a total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion. Therefore he muſt in reaſon be believed to have intended it, when and where that could not be, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial merſation, affuſion or aſperſion, as the caſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the time, place, and perſon might require.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. If any more were needful I might in the Fifth place add, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ordinarily ſo uſed, as beſides the ſignification of an act of <hi>application of water to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon baptized,</hi> to conſignifie alſo all the other proper circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>baptizing,</hi> both for matter and manner, that are omitted, where it is expreſſed: as for inſtance when 'tis ſaid of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is taken for the whole work and action of the Sacrament, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. Leigh. <hi>Critic. Sacra.</hi>
                  </note> (<hi>Act.</hi> 9.18.) <hi>that he aroſe, and was baptized,</hi> it is meant that none of the proper circumſtances of <hi>baptiſm</hi> were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107492:40"/> then omitted, though not one of them be expreſſed. So then our Saviour ſaying, <hi>Go and make Heathens diſciples baptizing them,</hi> muſt be underſtood to mean, that all the proper circumſtances of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> both in point of matter and form, muſt accompany that act. Now if the manner of baptizing at that time muſt determine our Saviours order to one circumſtance, then, no diſcrimination being made, it muſt determine it to the others alſo, and ſo we muſt in all points be <hi>baptized</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; only in Rivers or Lakes: not in the night,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> Hor. Heb. in Matt. <hi>3.6.</hi> pag. <hi>45,</hi> &amp;c.</note> nor on the Sabbath day, nor on any holy day; the party muſt firſt be put naked by others into the water, and there ſit, or ſtand, up to the neck; he muſt there learn ſome precepts of the Law, hard as well as eaſie, and then he muſt at one plunge wholly <hi>dip himſelf,</hi> or be dipt by another. And now let our <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſay in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whether they think all this ſhould be punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Chriſtian baptiſm;</hi> and therefore comprehended under our Saviours word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe this was the manner of baptizing in that time and place, when and where our Saviour ſpake that word, I am of opinion they do not think ſo, becauſe both the Apoſtles did, and the Church hath, and themſelves do act differently in ſome reſpect from this manner and order. For the firſt company that ever the Apoſtles baptized after the ſealing of their Commiſſion to baptize with water, by their own being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire, was on the day of Pentecoſt, an <hi>holy day. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> baptized the Jaylor and his family in <hi>the night.</hi> And it has been the Churches practice in times of perſecution to baptize in <hi>the night,</hi> and in latter times in <hi>Fonts,</hi> at firſt larger, after leſſer, and for many ages by a <hi>threefold immerſion.</hi> And as in the night the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do, or (if they be now grown more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,) have formerly baptized in the night; ſo their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, I ſuppoſe, are not <hi>put into the water</hi> by their Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107492:41"/> but go in of themſelves; neither (I think) are they now <hi>naked,</hi> but have ſome Linnen Garment on; neither do ſo much as the <hi>Women dip themſelves,</hi> but even they are dipped by their Baptizer, differently from the manner of baptizing in our Saviour's days. Then neither the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, nor the Church hath, nor themſelves do, think themſelves obliged by vertue of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to conform in all points to the manner and order of baptizing in uſe, at that time, and in that place, where our Saviour ſpake that word. They then who cannot but ſee, that the Church of Chriſt hath varied, and who themſelves do vary in ſome circumſtances, from the manner and order uſed then and there, when and where our Saviour ſpake that word, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon, and ought not in juſtice, to tie us to the exact obſervation of others: unleſs they will be guilty of that high crime of uncharitableneſs, or rather injuſtice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, which conſiſts in condemning others for what they do themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> varying from the order of baptizing in uſe, in that time and place, wherein our Saviour gave his order for baptizing: and then St. <hi>Paul</hi> will have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay to them, which I leave them to read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For the firſt Age, to begin with that, there were few, except the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> that writ any thing: and of what they wrote little is left; and of that little, nothing, that I know of, concerns the queſtion in hand. The Reaſon may well be conceived to have been, becauſe it then was no queſtion; and the rather becauſe we find the Practice, we contend for, in being, in after Ages; which is a fair inducement to believe it to have been deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence to them, unleſs it could be certainly told when, where, and by whom, it was afterward firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Church.

What <hi>probabilities</hi> then, (and I will not pretend to more than a <hi>probability</hi>) of ſuch a practice in the <hi>Apoſtles Age,</hi> as I have either conceived of my ſelf, or received from others, I will here fairly communicate, and then leave the Reader to make his judgment upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;<note place="margin">Quod <hi>univerſa</hi> tenet <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> nec Conciliis inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum eſt, non niſi <hi>Authoritate Apoſtolicà</hi> traditum rectiſſimè cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.

The bare but pronouncing of the <hi>form</hi> of words, which the Learned generally judge were <hi>preſcribed by our Saviour</hi> to be uſed in <hi>baptizing,</hi> ſo many thouſand times over (unleſs he uſed a <hi>plural form,</hi> of which yet there is no appearance, and the <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> is more <hi>applicative,</hi> and <hi>affecting</hi>) had been enough to have tired one man; much more that, and the action of putting ſo many perſons all wholly under the water.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. But it is not ſaid in the Text, that <hi>He alone,</hi> or that he at all baptized them: only that they were baptized. But it is rationally ſuppoſable, that as our Saviour had joyned the reſt of the Apoſtles in Commiſſion with him, and had ſealed that Commiſſion to them by the <hi>deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as to him; and that as they ſtood up with him, as vouchers of what he would ſay, when he began to preach, ſo they aſſiſted him in the action, when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107492:47"/> he began to Baptize. But ſtill what are <hi>eleven</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> men to the baptizing of <hi>three thouſand</hi> by way of <hi>total immerſion?</hi>

And for the <hi>pool of Betheſda,</hi> if that may be conceived to be the place, it is hardly probable (if it were of that <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>) that it was of that <hi>capaciouſreſs</hi> to afford room in any reaſonable time for the baptizing of <hi>three</hi> (much leſs of <hi>five) thouſand</hi> men. And that it did not afford that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, either upon account of the incapaciouſneſs of it, or of ſome other uſe of it (as to waſh the entrails of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107492:48"/> Beaſts offered in Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) rendring it unfit for that people ſo ſtudious of cleanneſs (even to a ſuperſtitiouſneſs) to immerſe themſelves in it, is probable, becauſe when <hi>John</hi> baptized, it is ſaid <hi>there went out unto him all the land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and they of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and were all baptized of him in the river of</hi> Jordan (St. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5.) which had been needleſs had there been conveniency for their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at home. And when it is ſaid that <hi>John</hi> was baptizing in <hi>Aenon,</hi> becauſe there was <hi>much water</hi> there, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23.) it intimates a want of that conveniency in other places of <hi>Judea,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf, for them of that place to be baptized in; where doubtleſs elſe he would have choſen to have <hi>baptized</hi> as moſt conducing to the purpoſe he came about, and baptized for, had there been in it that conveniency for it. And if there were not conveniency for the <hi>baptizing</hi> of ſuch numbers in the City, ſince we read not of their going out of the City to be baptized elſewhere, in all probability they were baptized in ſuch a way, as ſuited with the circumſtance of the place they were in; and then it muſt be by <hi>aſperſion</hi> or <hi>affuſion;</hi> ſince there was not conveniency in the City for their <hi>total immerſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. And yet ſtill ſuppoſing the <hi>Baptizers</hi> never <hi>ſo many,</hi> and the <hi>waters</hi> there never ſo <hi>plentiful,</hi> their baptizing by a <hi>total immerſion</hi> is very <hi>improbable.</hi> For it muſt needs be granted, that it was a <hi>tumultuary</hi> convention, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> preached unto, which ſuddenly came together, upon the noiſe of what had befallen the Apoſtles, upon the <hi>deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon them. And it will not, I think, be denied that it was a <hi>confuſed multitude,</hi> a mixture of people of different <hi>Sexes,</hi> and ages, as well as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and countries.

And now let the unbiaſſed Reader judge, what probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there is of their being <hi>totally dipped:</hi> and how far it is from being improbable, that they were otherwiſe baptized.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. I proceed to another inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Baptiſm of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. He had ſeen a Viſion by the way from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> and that an aſtoniſhing one, ſuch an one as made him <hi>fall to the earth, v.</hi> 4. ſuch a ſight as made him <hi>blind, v.</hi> 8. Upon that he was led to the City, and there, whether in that Conſternation, or other Prophetick rapture, or Penitential exerciſe of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he continued three days, and did neither eat nor drink. After three days comes <hi>Ananias</hi> ſent from God unto him, opens his eyes, declares unto him the deſign of God in this diſpenſation, exhorts him to ariſe, and be <hi>baptized</hi> in order to his further adaptment for the Service whereto God had deſigned him. He comports with the Will of God, and aroſe, and was Baptized. But how? By a <hi>total immerſion</hi> of him? That is not ſaid. Nor is it in the leaſt probable. Firſt conſider the time of the year when it is ſuppoſed to have been done; on <hi>the five and twentieth day of January,</hi> the ſterneſt and ſevereſt Seaſon of all that cold Winter quarter. Then conſider the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Perſon, a man firſt ſo enfeebled by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Viſion, that he was not able to go or ſtand, but fell to the earth, and was fain to be led by others: and then continuing after it three whole days together without
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107492:49"/> eating or drinking. Thirdly, conſider that his <hi>baptizing</hi> was in the time of his weakneſs, and before he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any meat to get ſtrength. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. And now after all this, let the impartial Reader judge, what probability there is in it, or rather how utterly improbable it is, that under thoſe circumſtances he was baptized by a total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion; and how much more probable it is, that water was brought to him that was not able to go to it; and he more gently aſperſed with it, that was too weak to endure the ſeverity of a total immerſion into it; or yet that, if there were any dipping in the caſe, it was but his head, or perhaps no more than his face, that was dipped: and how far after Ages are from being to blame in conſulting the healths and lives of their weak Infants at their baptizing, by only aſperſing or affuſing water on them, when they ſee in the Word of God ſuch great probabilities of this dear choſen Veſſel's being ſo baptized.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. There is a Third inſtance looking this way in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. I cannot pretend to a certainty from thence, more than from any other place; only (methinks) there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of probability of a <hi>baptiſm</hi> by <hi>aſperſion</hi> in it, and no certainty of a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> more than can be drawn from the bare ſignification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we have long ſince ſhewn to have no ſuch cogency in it that way, as neceſſarily to infer a <hi>total immerſion</hi> of the party to whom it is applied, where-ever it is uſed. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being ſent for by <hi>Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> and being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by a Viſion to go to him upon his ſending, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he was come, preached the Goſpel to him, and his company. Whileſt he was preaching, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> fell on all them which heard the Word. (<hi>v.</hi> 44.) St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing them thus <hi>baptized</hi> before-hand with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it but fitting that they, though <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhould be alſo <hi>baptized with water,</hi> (v. 47.) and thereupon command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. (<hi>v.</hi> 48.) And though their <hi>baptizing</hi> be not expreſſed, yet it is but rational to conceive they were <hi>baptized.</hi> By the laſt words
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107492:50"/> in the Chapter, which expreſs their deſiring of him then to tarry certain days, it ſeems as if they had not gone out of his preſence, but had continued with him all the time of their <hi>baptizing,</hi> which was performed betwixt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be baptized, and their deſiring him to tarry. Then they went not out of the Houſe; then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of a <hi>total immerſion</hi> incline to believe the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi> was by a way of leſs inconveniency: eſpecially when the Apoſtle's manner of expreſſion, when he argues from their inward <hi>baptiſm</hi> to their right unto an outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, is conſidered. (<hi>v.</hi> 47.) <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> He doth not ſay, can any Man forbid them (we may ſuppoſe) going abroad to the water to be baptized therein? but, can any Man <hi>forbid water</hi> (we may ſuppoſe) to be brought hither, that they may be <hi>baptized</hi> therewith? As if he had ſaid, The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> having in this place already begun, and done his part of <hi>baptiſm</hi> in falling upon them, it is but convenient that in the ſame place we ſhould do our part, and <hi>baptize them with water</hi> alſo; that ſo they may not go away with a <hi>half baptiſm,</hi> but have their baptiſm completed. Therefore let even ſome water be brought hither, and let them be ſealed with the outward affuſions of that upon their bodies, who are already ſealed with the inward effuſions of the Spirit upon their Souls. I cannot, I ſay, pretend hence invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to prove they were not dipped: but how probable it is they were only ſprinkled, I leave to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſolution of the calm and unprejudicated Reader.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. There is a Fourth inſtance, (in <hi>Act.</hi> 16.) wherein is no leſs, if not a greater probability of a baptiſm by <hi>aſperſion,</hi> than in this. At <hi>Philippi</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended and beaten, are thruſt into the inner Priſon, and have their Feet made faſt in the Stocks. At Midnight there is an Earth-quake, the Priſon doors are opened, and the Priſoners bands looſed. The <hi>Jaylor</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107492:50"/> what was done, is affrighted; asks <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> what he ſhould do to be ſaved? They preach the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his Houſe. By their preaching he and his (all that were capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing) are converted. Upon his converſion he becomes as kind to them, as before he had been cruel. And remembring the ſeverity of the ſtripes he gave them, he applies water for the waſhing away of the blood he drew from them. And at the ſame time is <hi>baptized</hi> both he himſelf, and all his. <hi>Baptized?</hi> Yes: that he was. But how! By <hi>dipping?</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling?</hi> or other applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water, leſs than a <hi>total immerſion?</hi> The Text ſays it not: it ſpeaks nothing more than that he was <hi>baptized.</hi> We are wholly left then to conjecture. What ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to think of a <hi>total immerſion</hi> here? There is no mention of their going from the Priſon to any River or Pool to dip them there. Nor is there, though <hi>Grotius</hi> conjecture it, any mention of any <hi>Pool,</hi> that was within the precincts of the Priſon, wherein they might be <hi>dipped.</hi> Nor was there any need of it: leſs water than a Pool would ſerve to waſh their ſtripes; and another kind of waſhing, than that of dipping was more proper for that purpoſe. One would think a gentle bathing, and wiping off the blood, with a ſoft cloth, or a tender hand, the moſt proper action in that caſe. Let us but conſult what we our ſelves would do in the like concern, and our reaſon will do us right in it. No probability then of his going to dip them, but only of his calling for water to waſh them. And then as little probability of their carrying him, and all his Family too, any whither elſe, in a ſtrange place, and at <hi>mid night</hi> too, to <hi>dip</hi> them.<note place="margin">Item multi (ſc. baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti) in domibus privatis, <hi>Act. 16.</hi> &amp; <hi>18. 1 Cor. 1.16.</hi> ubi ingreſſus ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi in aquas vix eſſe potuit. <hi>Walaeus</hi> Synopſ.

                  </note> All that can be imagined fairly, and without a violent detortion in this caſe is but this; that finding him to be a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> took the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his bringing water for the waſhing of their bodies, to make uſe

And now let the unbiaſſed, and unpaſſionate Reader coolly judge, in whether Opinion is the greater probability, that, which is for his <hi>total immerſion,</hi> or that, which is for ſome milder way of <hi>baptization;</hi> there being pleadable, as on the one ſide no neceſſity; ſo on the other great conveniency.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. There is yet one inſtance more that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, which, were it clear beyond exception, would be of mighty concernment in the caſe, even ſo far as to have the caſting voice in the debate. But it is liable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore I ſhall only propoſe it as diſputable, and leave the Reader, after all, to make what eſtimate he pleaſes of it, according to thoſe degrees of probability, or improbability, that ſhall appear to him to be in it, yet not altogether without hope, but that, when what is ſaid, for, and againſt it, ſhall be diſpaſſionately conſidered, it may, to modeſt and ſober inquirers, prove convincing and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107492:57"/> and which is alſo referred to by <hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>T. C.</hi> The Story is this; that in the time of <hi>Marc. Aurel. Antoninus</hi> (who began his reign <hi>An. Chr.</hi> 161.) a certain Jew travelling together with ſome Chriſtians was Converted, and falling very ſick, deſired <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> but that they, having neither Prieſt to do it, nor <hi>Water</hi> to do it withal, at firſt refuſed him: yet afterwards, overcome by his urgent importunities, yielded, as far as they could, to his requeſt, and <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſand</hi> inſtead of water three times upon him, they baptized him in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Whereupon the man recovered. Now if <hi>ſprinkling of water</hi> in Baptiſm, at leaſt in ſome caſes, had not been an uſe, and that a known one, at that time, how ſhould it have come into their heads to have uſed any ſuch action? As in the form of words it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they kept cloſe to the Eccleſiaſtick uſage, ſo it is not to be doubted, but they did ſo in the manner of acting. And when report was made of what was done to the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or more probably of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and his opinion asked in the caſe, he after conſultation had with the Church about it, thereunto anſwered, that the man was baptized, <hi>ſi modo aquâ denuo perfunderetur</hi> (as they ſay) were he but <hi>ſprinkled</hi> again with water, or had he but water <hi>poured</hi> on him again. Where 'tis plain, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was diſapproved of in that action, or declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, not the Baptizer, not the form of Words, not the manner of application by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> but only the want of that Element which was proper for Baptiſm: which if uſed, though in the ſame way of application to him, that the <hi>Sand</hi> had been, the Baptiſm was pronounced to be ſufficient. Than which what proof can be deſired more clear or more full? A like Story to this, if not the very ſame with this, <hi>Johannes Moſcus,</hi> who lived about the year 600 relates to have happened in his time, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> pag. 348.</p>

Now that the ſpeech hath reference unto <hi>baptiſm,</hi> the words immediately fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going do ſufficiently intimate.

And of this ſprinkling, beſides what is implied in the former teſtimonies, there was ſome little uſe in the Primitive Church. <hi>Quis enim tam infidae poenitentiae viro aſperginem unam cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſlibet aquae commodabit?</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107492:60"/> was his opinion touching them that were <hi>baptized</hi> in their weakneſs and languiſhment; and anſwers that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed by <hi>Magnus</hi> to him, whether thoſe that were ſo baptized were to be accounted lawful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in regard they had not been ſo baptized as could properly and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called a <hi>lotion,</hi> but rather a <hi>perfuſion,</hi> that is, not being <hi>carried to the water,</hi> and there <hi>waſhed with it,</hi> but having <hi>water brought to them,</hi> and in <hi>ſprinkling: drops</hi> poured on them. And to the point he anſwers, that he conceives that the divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits can in none be maimed and weakned: that is, as I conceive his meaning to be, there is <hi>never the leſs grace</hi> of God beſtowed in <hi>baptiſm</hi> for the littleneſs of the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one is baptized, where there is no defect of Faith in the Giver and Receiver. And that in the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sacraments, when mans neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty compels him to ſeek, and God is pleaſed to beſtow his indulgence, <hi>divine compendiums</hi> do the whole buſineſs for believers. And that none ought to be troubled at it, becauſe <hi>ſick perſons</hi> are ſeen to be <hi>sprinkled,</hi> or to have water ſhed upon them, when they are <hi>baptized,</hi> being they read in ſeveral places of Scripture mentions of <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of water for <hi>purifications</hi> from uncleanneſs, even natural as well as legal. Whence he conceives it apparent, that in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:107492:60"/> even the <hi>sprinkling of water</hi> is as good as <hi>other waſhing</hi> with it. And declares, that according to his opinion whoſoever ſhall in the Church, by the law and right of Faith, have obtained the <hi>divine</hi> grace, (that is, be <hi>baptized,</hi> even though by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> as by the ſubject of this diſcourſe it muſt neceſſarily be underſtood) is to be accounted a <hi>lawful Chriſtian.</hi> And in fine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the experience, which was had, how free ſome were from that foul ſpirit, which they were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled withal before; how laudably and commendably they lived in the Church; how by the increaſing of their Faith, they every day grew more and more in heavenly grace, who upon urgent neceſſity had been Baptized in their ſickneſs. Which ſo clear and full an evidence from ſo eminent a Father, and Martyr as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and ſo early in the Church as he was, ſhould methinks be of mighty weight to ſatisfie even the niceſt ſcrupuloſity of any ſober doubter in the caſe.</p>

               <p n="40">§. 40. And if we conſult the reaſon, on which the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> grounded this Canon, it will appear to be ſo. That was, not becauſe their Baptiſm was unlawful, and a meer nullity (as ſome ſay by ours) but becauſe the faith (<hi>i. e.</hi> as I conceive, the <hi>confeſſion of the faith</hi>) of thoſe that would not be baptized, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved themſelves to be no longer Men of this World,<note place="margin">Non enim fides illius voluntaria, ſed ex ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate eſt.</note> but juſt depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, was not voluntary, but meerly upon neceſſity. And high reaſon certainly was on that Councils ſide: It being unfit that they upon choice ſhould be made Shepheards, who would not but upon neceſſity declare themſelves Sheep. No hope being that they would ever die for the Faith, who till they were going to die, would never declare themſelves to be of the Faith. Little expectation, that they ſhould ever by example at their Death encourage others to be Martyrs, who never in their life, before they were going to die, had the courage to own themſelves ſo much as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
               <p n="41">§. 41. And yet was not the Council ſo rigid neither in its cenſure, as utterly to exclude them from the very
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107492:63"/> Prieſthood it ſelf, but left a Door open for them, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that. There was a <hi>niſi,</hi> an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the caſe:<note place="margin">Niſi forte poſtea ipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſtudium &amp; fides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilis fuerit, aut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum raritas cogat.

                  </note> and upon ſeveral conſiderations they might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. One was in caſe they did (after their recovery) by very great diligence in their future actings approve themſelves fitted for it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was in caſe their faith did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf ſuch, as was like to <hi>abide</hi> in the day of Tryal. And laſtly, in caſe there was a <hi>ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of other Men fit to be taken up into holy Orders. Now certainly they would never in any caſe have admitted them to be <hi>Prieſts,</hi> whom they had not judged to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> They would never have permitted them to be <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> whom they did not believe to have been <hi>baptized.</hi> It is plain therefore it was the doubt, which they had of the truth of their faith, not any queſtion they made of the validity of their baptiſm, that was the ground of their making this Canon. Which yet may receive further confirmation from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cuſtom in the Church,<note place="margin">Concil. Carthag. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> which was, to admit none to be of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, who had been <hi>put to penance.</hi> For this ſhews that the thing required to capacitate Men for the Clergy, was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable Chriſtianity.</hi> But the <hi>Clinicks</hi> deferring their baptiſm ſo long, and on ſuch reaſons as they deferred it, rendred their Chriſtianity ſuſpicious and queſtionable. And ſo thence it was, not from the manner of their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, that they were debarred the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p n="42">§. 42. And ſo, upon all accounts, this Council is a fair evidence of a practice of baptizing by way even of <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> ſo early in the Church as the beginning of the Fourth Century.</p>

And that yet in that condition they were baptized, it is likewiſe evident from his preſſing them to be baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had ſo far loſt the uſe of their tongue, that they were not able well to utter, what was on their part to be ſaid at their baptizing; and whileſt their commencing Chriſtians might be grounded on certain arguments, and nor on uncertain opinion; with much more to that purpoſe. Now how perſons in this condition could be baptized by a <hi>total dipping,</hi> or any other way but by a gentle <hi>ſprinkling</hi> (unleſs the Baptizer meant to put them out of doubt, and diſpatch them quickly out of the way) the indifferent Reader may with hope of a favourable judgment in the caſe be appealed unto. In the mean time I cannot but take notice of it, that whereas the unlawfulneſs of ſuch a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was the moſt powerful argument that poſſibly could be uſed, to draw men off from ſuch a courſe, and haſten their baptizing, if ever they meant at all to be baptized, ſince that on death bed (by <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> and thoſe in that condition were incapable of any other) was perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, (beſides that it ſignified nothing at all to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized) becauſe not adminiſtred according to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which is ſuppoſed to be by dipping, he doth not in the leaſt preſs that argument; nor do any of the Fathers elſe, that I know of: which is a clear evidence, that though he and they wiſhed men ſooner <hi>baptized,</hi> yet they thought that <hi>baptiſm,</hi> which was adminiſtred ſo late, to be in it ſelf lawful, though through their fault, ſo late adminiſtred, and in that manner.</p>

In that Council the Canon, which concerns the baptizing of Infants, is delivered in ſuch terms, as ſpeak differing ways of baptizing, <hi>viz.</hi> either by <hi>immerging,</hi> or by <hi>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,</hi> that is, by dipping or ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (or otherwiſe wetting than by dipping) in uſe in that Church. It adds alſo, that the thrice repeated immerſion or tinction, expreſſes a type of our Lord's three days Sepulture or burial. Now it is plain, that though <hi>tingo,</hi> where it ſtands alone, doth not denote any particular way of baptizing, but notes baptizing in general, without reference to any particular way of it, and is ſo uſed in the writings of Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors both ancient, and Modern; yet when it is ſet with <hi>immergo,</hi> and in contradiſtinction to it, then it notes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of baptizing than that, whether by aſperſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, or perfuſion, and not dipping, as I have before ſufficiently ſhewed, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>S.</hi> 6, 7.

               <p>
                  <q>The next, that is brought in to charge us, is <hi>Leigh</hi> (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is pleaſed without any the leaſt title of reſpect to introduce that honourable Gentleman) and he (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) in his <hi>Critica Sacra,</hi> ſaith, Its native and proper ſignification is to dip into water, or to <hi>plunge</hi> under water; for which he cites theſe Scriptures, where ſo uſed, viz. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. (it ſhould be 16.) <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. And that it is taken from a Dyer's Fat, and imports a <hi>Dying,</hi> or giving a <hi>freſh Colour,</hi> and not a bare waſhing only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.13. And for which he quotes <hi>Caſaubon, Bucan, Bullinger, Zanchy, Spanhemius.</hi> He ſaith withal, That ſome would have it ſignifie <hi>waſhing,</hi> and which ſence <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> he ſaith, oppoſed, affirming, that it was not otherwiſe ſo, than by conſequence, for the proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was ſuch a dipping or plunging, as Dyers uſe for Dying of Clothes.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. It is comfortable, that the <hi>Author</hi> is to be eaſily had, and the <hi>place</hi> conſulted. And for anſwer hereto little need be ſaid to him, that ſhall conſult the place. The firſt view, that ſhall be taken of it, will ſufficiently vindicate Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and the truth. And becauſe it is material, and all Perſons, that ſhall be concerned in this debate, may not be in condition to conſult, or make the beſt advantage of that paſſage of that Author; therefore I will here by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees give a total tranſcription of it.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:107492:91"/>§. 18. It is true, Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, That the native and proper ſignification of it is to <hi>dip</hi> into water, or to plunge under water, for which he cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. and alſo (what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> omits) <hi>John</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. But firſt I have made it appear in theſe Papers, that neither <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. nor <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. prove that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word. A <hi>baptizing</hi> they prove; but not a <hi>dipping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. Secondly, though it be probable from <hi>John</hi> 3.22. that the baptizing in <hi>Aenon</hi> was by dipping, yet that is not ſo much from the force of the word, as from that addition of the reaſon of <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing there, which was, becauſe <hi>there was much water there.</hi> And yet, if a Man would diſpute it ſtifly, even that reaſon will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively prove it. This it will prove, that it was a place of great conveniency for <hi>John</hi>'s purpoſe to baptize confluences of People in: (1.) Becauſe there were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <hi>deep,</hi> but <hi>many</hi> waters there. That may mean this, and nothing elſe but this, that there were there many ſeveral places of conveniency for baptizing, by reaſon of the windings in and out of the Brook, Maeander-wiſe, ſo that one company might be privately fitting and preparing themſelves for baptiſm in one place, whilſt <hi>John</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring it to another company in another place, or here a company of Men by themſelves, and there a company of Women by themſelves, as afterward in the Chriſtian Church there were diſtinct apartments in the Baptiſteries for the <hi>Men,</hi> and for the <hi>Women;</hi> and ſo the actions of ſtripping themſelves, and going into, and coming out of the water naked, might be performed with more decency, and leſs obſervance; not with that diſturbance to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not with that violence unto modeſty, which muſt needs be, where the baptizing place was but one, and the multitudes to be baptized all together. And (2.) this is ſtill the more probable, if we imagine any <hi>Women</hi> were baptized there alſo, as well as <hi>Men.</hi> And it is reaſonable enough to imagine it, when it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107492:91"/> 
                  <hi>there went out to him Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him;</hi> and when it is remembred, that the <hi>Women</hi> alſo among the <hi>Jews</hi> were admitted unto Proſelytiſm <hi>by Baptiſm,</hi> as well as the Men. For great caution and reſpect unto the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine modeſty was had amongſt that <hi>jealous</hi> as well as <hi>luſtful</hi> People in the baptizing of their <hi>Women,</hi> that neither themſelves might be put to the bluſh, nor others have any laſcivious thoughts ſtirred up in them by any thing ſeen, or obſervable, in the baptizing of them. And if this be a probable account of the reaſon given for <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing in <hi>Aenon,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>many waters there</hi> (and I appeal even unto Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf whether it be not) then can that reaſon conduce nothing to the proving, that the baptiſm performed there was by dipping. For not the <hi>multitude</hi> of waters, but the <hi>deepneſs</hi> and <hi>wideneſs</hi> of the water, had been proper to have been alledged in that caſe. And <hi>John</hi> might baptize many perſons, and companies of Perſons, in theſe many ſeveral, and not far diſtant waters, and yet dip none of them totally in any of them. And this is all it will prove.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. But thirdly, though it might be infallibly proved from theſe, or any other places, that the baptiſm, then and there, was by dipping, yet that can only prove, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to dip; and is ſometimes uſed in that ſenſe: (and we that are for <hi>dipping</hi> as well as for <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> are willing it ſhould ſignifie the one, as well as the other) but it cannot prove, that it ſignifies nothing more but to dip, and is never uſed in any other ſignification. And this indeed is the great miſtake, that becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth (and, if ye will, primarily and properly) to dip, therefore they will not grant, that it ſignifieth any thing elſe, eſpecially in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it hath a latitude in its import and uſe, as well as moſt words elſe have, and is granted ſo to have by Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in that Sacrament, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> the Author quoted by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> againſt it, as we ſhall ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>Baptizo,</hi> often. And then he goes on (whether as ſpeaking his own ſenſe, or Dr. <hi>Featlyes,</hi> or his own ſenſe in Dr. <hi>Featlyes</hi> words, whoſe name I ſee ſet in the end of the Period) The word <hi>Baptize,</hi> though it be derived from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ringo,</hi> to dip, or plunge into the water, and ſignifieth primarily ſuch a kind of waſhing as is uſed in Bucks, where Linen is plunged and dipt: yet it is taken more largely for <hi>any kind of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> rinſing, or cleanſing, <hi>even where there is no dipping at all,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. and 20.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. and 10.38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.5. and 11.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. This Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould, methinks, have taken notice of, as well as of that which he tranſcribed, and reported this too to have been Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s ſenſe of the word, as well as the other, if he had meant to do right to Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and not be diſingenuous both to the truth and him. For whilſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary people hear only what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith from Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> and hear not alſo what Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith of himſelf, they are apt to think, that what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> reports from him, is all that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaid of the thing, and that he was of Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>'s judgment, imbued with the ſame Sentiments with him, dipt into the ſame error that he is.</p>

                  </gap>, a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to ſave himſelf whole from any thing that can be ſaid againſt him for his omiſſions; and to that I ſhall now attend him. He tells us, that he [<hi>i. e.</hi> Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>] ſaith withal, that ſome would have it to ſignifie <hi>waſhing</hi> (he might have been ſo kind as to have told us who) and which ſenſe <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (he ſaith) oppoſed, affirming that it was not otherwiſe ſo, than by conſequence: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification was ſuch a <hi>dipping</hi> or plunging as <hi>Dyers</hi> uſe for <hi>dying</hi> of clothes.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. He ſhould have told us, that it was the ſenſe of Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> himſelf, as well as of others. But then Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Teſtimony had been againſt him, as well as for him, and ſo had ſignified nothing to his advantage. For to grant it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>dipping,</hi> and yet to ſay (as Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> doth) that it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107492:94"/> ſignifies <hi>ſprinkling</hi> too, ſpoils all, and will do the <hi>Dippers</hi> no ſervice.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. And whereas he tells us, that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> oppoſed that ſenſe, affirming that it was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo, than by conſequence. I anſwer firſt, that if it be but any way ſo, whether directly, or by conſequence, it is all one to our purpoſe, and will do our buſineſs as well. Let it but ſignifie <hi>waſhing,</hi> and that as diſtinct from <hi>dipping,</hi> and then whether it ſignifie ſo directly, or by conſequence, baptizing will not neceſſarily import dipping. Secondly, I anſwer, that Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> doth not ſay, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Senſe. But that which he ſaith is this, that whereas the <hi>Vulg. Latin</hi> rendred <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. by <hi>baptizentur,</hi> he tells us in his Margin from <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> 7. that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> deſervedly changed it: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in that place the diſcourſe is not of that ſolemn waſhing, whereunto (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi>) now by long uſage of all Churches the term of Baptiſm hath been Dedicated and Conſecrated. Nor indeed, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> (not <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifie <hi>lavare,</hi> but by conſequence: for properly it ſignifies to <hi>dip</hi> in order unto <hi>dying:</hi> which he proves by inſtances from <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Nazianz.</hi> as may be ſeen in his Notes, on <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 4. Nor does any body deny its ſignifying to <hi>dip,</hi> the granting of it being no way prejudicial to our Hypotheſis, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not on what the word primarily and ſtrictly noteth in its firſt impoſition and uſe, but on what it is uſed, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily and more generally, to import in the Scriptures and Eccleſiaſtical Writers; and that as we have ſhewed in theſe Papers, is a waſhing in order unto the attaining of thoſe Spiritual ends ordained by the Inſtitutor of that Sacrament, however performed, whether by Dipping or by Sprinkling, by putting into water, or by pouring of water on the Party baptized. And the Reader of this Authors Writings may do well from hence to take warning, that he be not too haſty in giving credit to ſuch a Writer's quotations, as in his reports from Authors takes a liberty to chop and change,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107492:94"/> to put in or leave out, as may beſt ſerve, not the truth, but his own advantage.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. I cannot, before I paſs hence, but propoſe to the conſideration of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> or any elſe that inſiſt on that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Beza</hi>'s, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifies <hi>to dip in order unto dying;</hi> whether any dipping that is done, not in order unto dying, be properly a Baptiſm, or no? If not, then, unleſs they dip, when they baptize, <hi>in order unto dying,</hi> theirs is no baptiſm, no more than ours: becauſe though theirs be a dipping, yet it is not a Dipping in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto Dying. If it be, as they muſt ſay it is, becauſe it is impoſſible otherwiſe to juſtifie their own way to be a lawful baptizing; then I infer, either that Chriſtians are not bound to ſtand always, no not in Sacramental rites, to the proper and ſtrict ſignifications of words, and ſo we are free from blame, as to that, in what we practiſe, as well as they: or elſe they are guilty in what they practiſe, as well as we; in that they deviate in their practice from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, not acting according to the proper import of the word in it. For though they ſtick cloſe to the Act, and dip, yet they deviate from the End of the Act, and <hi>dip not for dying.</hi> And it is the <hi>End</hi> that ſpecifies the Action.</p>
               <p n="29">§. 29. And again I propoſe, whether the inſiſting ſo ſtrictly on this Notion of the word do not tend to the ſtrengthning of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their notion of an <hi>Indelible Character</hi> introduced by Baptiſm on the Soul. For if bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing be, according to the proper ſignification of the word, a <hi>dipping in order unto dying;</hi> and there is no Dye brought by the baptiſmal water on the body; it remains that by baptizing there be a Dye brought upon the Soul, and that is, or may be the Character they contend for. If this be not to be granted, then is not that Notion fit to be received, or inſiſted on, but to be caſhiered. The next Author that calls for our attendance is <hi>Salmatius.</hi> And he in his Book <hi>de Prim. Papae, p.</hi> 193. ſaith (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) <q>That is not Baptiſm they give to Children, but Rhantiſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. I hope Mr. <hi>D.</hi> reports the Author right; not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107492:95"/> having him by me to examine. And if it be true, that he ſo ſay, (which the Reader may do well to demur upon, till he have the opportunity to ſee it in the Author) then I anſwer to him, that the word Baptiſm may be conſidered either more <hi>strictly,</hi> as ſignifying in particular, immerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or dipping, as it is moſtly uſed in <hi>Profane Authors;</hi> or more <hi>largely,</hi> as ſignifying in general, <hi>any waſhing,</hi> and, as it is uſed in <hi>Chriſtian Writers,</hi> to denote that Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal waſhing, whereby we are initiated into the Church, however performed, whether by putting into water, or by pouring water upon. If we take Baptiſm in the firſt and ſtrict ſenſe, then it is not Baptiſm they give to Children: for ſprinkling is not dipping. But if we take it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then it is: for to ſprinkle with the due form of words is to baptize. And ſo this Teſtimony is either imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or untrue. Let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> chuſe which he will have it to be.</p>
               <p n="31">§. 31. <q>After him follows <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> and He in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. annexed to the New Teſtament ſet forth by <hi>Stephens,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) ſaith, That immerging was the Proper Right in Baptiſm, which the word it ſelf (he ſaith) ſufficiently declares, which as it ſignifies not <gap reason="foreign">

For he ſays, the word <hi>baptized</hi> ſignifieth the true Act of the Miniſter to dip or dop the body, or <hi>ſome part of it</hi> into the water. This one word [or <hi>ſome part of it</hi>] hath quite ſpoil'd all Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> Teſtimony, as to the doing of the Dippers any ſervice in their cauſe. For nothing will ſerve their turn to be done in baptiſm, or ſignified by the word baptize, but a total dipping of the whole body, and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> Teſtimony reaches but a dipping of the body, <hi>or ſome part of it</hi> into the water.</p>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:107492:99"/>§. 51. And that this was not an expreſſion, that fell ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually from him, but was his very judgment, appears by what he ſaid before, That it ought to be the Churches part to cleave to the Inſtitution, eſpecially it being not left ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary by our Church to the diſcretion of the Miniſter, but required (as it then was) to dip or dive the Infant <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> except in caſe of weakneſs. A dipping, total or partial, the Man would have: but ſo there was but either, the Inſtitution was cleaved to, and the Churches order obſerved, ſo far as I can perceive, in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="52">§. 52. And that, as warm as Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> was for retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the uſe of Dipping, as witneſſed to by <hi>Antiquity,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Scripture,</hi> required by the <hi>Church</hi> (as then it was, with not ſo much appearance of liberty in the caſe granted to the Miniſter, as now is) and <hi>Symbolical</hi> with the things ſignified in Baptiſm, which I could wiſh as well as, and as heartily as he, in order to the making of peace in the Church, if that would do it, I ſay, that he was only ſo for dipping, as yet not to hold any unlawfulneſs to be in ſprinkling, there is ſufficient evidence, becauſe he thinks, that for the allowance of that, in caſe of weakneſs, we have cauſe to be thankful. And I preſume his zeal was only againſt thoſe, that ſtretcht the liberty of the Church in this caſe deeper and further, than either the Church her ſelf could, or the ſolemneſs of this Sacrament might well and ſafely admit, as himſelf ſpeaks. And as in the beginning of this Section he ſaith, <hi>I would not be underſtood, as if Schiſmatically I would inſtill a diſtaſt of the Church into any weak minds by the act of ſprinkling water only:</hi> ſo in the end of it he ſaith again, <hi>I do not ſpeak this as a thing meet to diſturb a Churches peace, but as deſiring ſuch as it concerns, in their places to look to their liberty and duty in this behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="53">§. 53. And I ſhall conclude with a wiſh, that the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of him would have but the ſame thoughts of it, as his <hi>Author</hi> had, and there would ſoon be an agreement with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107492:99"/> him and the Church, which <hi>requires dipping,</hi> but <hi>allows sprinkling,</hi> on juſt reaſon for it. And if he had any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be baptized, he might have them dipped, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally too in it, if he deſired it. And I muſt needs ſay, that if there be any failure in this caſe, and perhaps there may be ſome, it is not in the <hi>Church,</hi> nor in her Orders; for by them <hi>dipping is preſcribed,</hi> unleſs where an inability well to endure it in the Infant is certified; but in the <hi>Actors,</hi> and if any way at all in the Baptizer, yet moſtly, if not ſolely, in the <hi>Bringers</hi> of the Infants unto Baptiſm; which every Man may have, as to his own concern, amended and reformed at his pleaſure. Nay, if I may ſpeak my thoughts, I believe the Miniſters of the Nation would be heartily glad, if the People would deſire, or be but willing to have their Infants dipped, after the ancient manner both in this and in other Churches, and bring them to Baptiſm in ſuch a condition, as that they might be totally dipped, without fear of being deſtroyed.</p>

               <p n="55">§. 55. I am not willing to ſay it, yet am apt to ſuſpect it, that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is the Author of thoſe words, and not Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi> My reaſon is, becauſe he gives us no particular direction to the place where they may be found. He quotes indeed, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. but he names not the Section, Rule, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor Page. And he had need have more time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than I, that ſhall make it his buſineſs to read over a <hi>Chapter of an hundred and ten pages in Folio,</hi> to find whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpeak true or no. He names afterward, when he had a mind to be found, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 644, 645. Why not here? I have ſhewed my ſuſpicion, and my reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. And I am ſtrengthened therein by this, that (as I ſhall ſhew afterwards) he quotes a ſaying of <hi>Muſculus,</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. at large, without naming verſe of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Page of the Book, and, as upon diligent ſearch I
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107492:100"/> have found, there are no ſuch words ſaid by <hi>Muſculus</hi> on that Chapter. And though I have not read all this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet I have read all the places in it, which ſpeak of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as far as I can find direction thereto by the <hi>Index:</hi> And no ſuch words appear to me therein. Nay, a Friend of mine, that hath twice peruſed the whole Chapter, upon the meer deſign of finding that paſſage in it, aſſures me that it is not there. And if it were, the anſwer thereto is very eaſie, that though what he names were the proper ſignification of the word, it doth not follow, that it muſt be taken in no other but that proper ſignification in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; in regard words are not in all places, and upon all occaſions, uſed in no other but that which is their proper ſignification; but ſometimes in acceptions very different, and remote from the firſt; as he that is but a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Rhetorick can tell. And this word in particular hath in the Eccleſiaſtical uſe of it (by a <hi>Metalepſis,</hi> or a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the <hi>Species</hi> for the <hi>Species</hi>) been of ancient time, even up to the beginning, for ought that any Man can prove to the contrary, uſed to ſignifie that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental waſhing, which we call baptiſm, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that ſpecifical way of dipping, but by any other way of waſhing, whether it be perfuſion, affuſion, or aſperſion.</p>
               <p n="56">§. 56. Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede</hi> is the next witneſs produced by Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> And he in his <hi>Diatribe,</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. ſaith, <q>That there was no ſuch thing as ſprinkling or Rhantiſm uſed in Baptiſm in the Apoſtles days, nor many Ages after them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="57">§. 57. To this I anſwer, (1.) If Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> had ſaid, he knew of no ſuch thing, or had read of no ſuch thing, it had been an expreſſion ſuitable to his modeſty. But poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to ſay, <hi>There was no ſuch thing,</hi> ſeems a ſtretch ſomewhat too far beyond what ought to have been ſaid. It is eaſie to ſay of a thing, that it <hi>was done</hi> in the Apoſtles days, when there appears juſt evidence for it. But who can ſay what was <hi>not done</hi> in the Days of the Apoſtles? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107492:100"/> he had read (what yet I am apt to think Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf, as great a Searcher into Antiquities as he was, would not have pretended to have read, <hi>viz.</hi>) all that has been writ of what was done in the Apoſtles days: and withall unleſs all that was done in their days had been written too, which no Man with any the leaſt appearance of reaſon can pretend to ſay. But great Men ſometimes take a pleaſure to ſay great things, and think that their greatneſs carries authority enough with it to bear them out in all they ſay. But it will not, beyond reaſon, when what they ſay comes to be examined by reaſon. And ſo this great Man's word here is of no more weight, than a great Man's word can be without its ground, whereof here he gives us none.</p>
               <p n="58">§. 58. And on the contrary to what he faith, I have in <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. ſhewn fair probabilities even of a ſprinkling or Rhantiſm uſed in Baptiſm even in the Apoſtles days.

And that we find it in moſt Ages after the Apoſtles, and can find no Original of it in any Age after theirs, this is probability enough of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in uſe even in their Age.</p>
               <p n="59">§. 59. Secondly, whereas Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, it was not uſed many Ages after the Apoſtles days (unleſs he mean, that it was not uſed ſolemnly and in publick, but only in private, and upon caſes of neceſſity, in which, if he ſay it, he doth not contradict us) I am not able to ſay, it is true,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107492:101"/> having by ſufficient inſtances already in theſe Papers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the contrary. And if what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſaith (<hi>p.</hi> 204.) be true, that <hi>until the Third Century we find not any, that upon any conſideration, did admit of sprinkling,</hi> yet if any in that Age did admit it, then there was ſuch a thing as Sprinkling or Rhantiſm uſed in Baptiſm (quite contrary to what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, and that even by the confeſſion of Mr. <hi>D.</hi>) not many Ages after the Apoſtles, Unleſs any will ſay, that the Third Century was many Ages after the Firſt, which yet I think none that underſtands Number and Multitude will ſay. And that ſome body in that Age did admit of it Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is our witneſs, who quotes <hi>Cyprian</hi> for it in his Epiſtle to <hi>Magnus, l.</hi> 4. <hi>ep.</hi> 7.

               </p>
               <p n="60">§. 60. But what, after all this, if Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in ſaying, <hi>no ſuch thing was uſed,</hi> did not mean, that <hi>no ſuch thing was done,</hi> but that it was not done ſo oft, as that the doing of it might be called an <hi>uſe;</hi> as if he had ſaid, no ſuch thing was come up, or grown into uſe, or to be an uſe? Then is his ſaying clearly reconcileable with what we ſay. For we contend but for the doing of it <hi>on ſome occaſions;</hi> not for its being the <hi>uſe</hi> ſo to do. And methinks his ſaying that no ſuch thing was <hi>uſed</hi> many Ages after the Apoſtles, muſt needs enforce that to be his meaning. For Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> was too knowing a Perſon in Antiquity, to be ignorant of it, that ſuch a thing as Sprinkling or Rhantiſm was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few Ages after the Apoſtles (and particularly St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Magnus</hi> muſt needs tell him it was done in the <hi>Third</hi>) though he knew it was not come ſo ſoon to be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107492:101"/> 
                  <hi>the uſe.</hi> And if that be his meaning, then are his words nothing at all to the purpoſe of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> as ſpeaking but the ſame that we ſay. If not, I ſhall add no more, but that <hi>Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus,</hi> it was a ſlip of his unwary Pen, whilſt his thoughts were more intent upon other matter.</p>
               <p n="61">§. 61. <hi>Chamier</hi> ſucceeds Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (one great man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another) and from his <hi>Pan. Cathol. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Ser.</hi> 6. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> quotes this. <q>The ancient uſe of Baptiſm was to dip the whole Body into the Element, which is the force <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: therefore did <hi>John</hi> Baptize in a River, which is, nevertheleſs changed into aſperſion, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain when, and from whence that Cuſtom was taken.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="62">§. 62. To this I Anſwer Firſt, that if <hi>Chamier</hi> did ſay, that the Ancient uſe of Baptiſm was to dip the whole body into the Element, then his meaning only was, that it was anciently the more <hi>general</hi> or more <hi>conſtant,</hi> or <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>ſolemn,</hi> but not the <hi>only</hi> manner, ſo to baptize. But this hurts not our cauſe, who do not contend that Sprinkling was the only, or the more general, or the more publick, and ſolemn way of baptizing in the ancient Church, but only that it was <hi>ſometimes,</hi> and moſtly in <hi>private,</hi> and in caſes of great <hi>neceſſity, charity,</hi> or <hi>conveniency,</hi> made uſe of in it. And as this hath been, I hope ſufficiently, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in theſe Papers, ſo the words of <hi>Chamier,</hi> even as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> reports them, do not contradict it: they only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming what anciently was in uſe, but not denying any thing elſe to have been then done. Suppoſe it ſhould be ſaid, that the Modern uſe of Baptiſm in this Kingdom for this laſt Century has been to ſprinkle water on the face of the baptized. Would this conclude that none in this Kingdom have been otherwiſe baptized in this laſt Century than by ſuch Sprinkling? I ſuppoſe not. Nor do I believe the thing true, if it ſhould be aſſerted. No more doth the affirming of the ancient uſe to have been dipping, conclude that there was none then any other way baptized than by dipping. As ſome therefore in the late times of the prevalency of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107492:102"/> Sprinkling have been dipped, ſo no doubt ſome in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times of the prevalency of dipping were ſprinkled.</p>
               <p n="63">§. 63.

                  </note> if <hi>Spanhemius</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter report him truly. His words are, That in the uſe of the Element at the beginning immerſion of the whole body was practiſed. Theſe words do only imply that at the firſt beginning to baptize, dipping of the whole body was in uſe, which we grant. But they do not imply that no other way of baptizing beſides dipping was then alſo uſed. Though that then were, yet there might be other ways alſo beſides that, for ought here ſaid by <hi>Chamier.</hi> And admitting that to have been the only way of baptizing at the very beginning of the uſe of that Sacrament, ſuppoſe in our Saviour's life, or juſt immediately after his death: yet if other ways of baptizing came into uſe preſently, or a little after, ſuppoſe in the time of the Apoſtles, then will thoſe ways of baptizing be good enough: though dipping have a little the ſtart of them, and be in priority of time ſomewhat before them. But this <hi>Chamier</hi> doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, only telling us what was at the beginning, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying what might preſently after follow.</p>

                  </gap> hath no other force but that, and that it is never uſed in any either profane or ſacred Writer but in <hi>this only</hi> ſignification, then we as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny it.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107492:102"/> that <hi>John</hi> did baptize in a River, becauſe that was the force of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; or elſe that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="66">§. 66. If the firſt be meant, it is ſaid without proof; nor can be credible, unleſs we could be aſſured of two things. (1.) That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies always exactly ſo, and never otherwiſe. (2.) That the Commiſſion, by vertue of which <hi>John</hi> did baptize, was given in Greek; and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was the particular word in that Commiſſion. But theſe two things will never be attempted to be ſhown, unleſs I take my meaſures much amiſs.</p>
               <p n="67">§. 67. If the Second be meant, and the force of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be concluded to be, to dip the whole body in the Element, becauſe <hi>John</hi> did baptize in a River, I anſwer, firſt, it is ridiculous to think, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould take its ſignification from any action of <hi>John</hi>'s, which was a word in poſſeſſion of its being and ſignification long before <hi>John</hi>'s either Baptiſm, or Birth. Secondly, the vanity of concluding, that Baptiſm ought to be by dipping the whole body, becauſe <hi>John</hi> baptized in a River, if that be it that is meant, and was deſigned by the <hi>Author,</hi> or <hi>Reporter</hi> (as I am apt to believe it was, and only by the <hi>Later</hi>) the vanity, I ſay, and unconcludingneſs (if I may ſo ſpeak) of that Argument hath already ſo oft been detected in theſe Papers, that I ſhall not vex the Reader with a tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition thereof. In ſhort therefore it ſignifies nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were impoſſible for a man to go into a River, and be baptized therein, by ſprinkling or pouring water on him, or dipping ſome part of him, as namely his face, or head into it, without his whole body be immerſed into it alſo: which no man of reaſon, or even of common ſenſe, will adventure to ſay.</p>
               <p n="68">§. 68. But I am apt to think that <hi>Chamier</hi> did not ſay any ſuch thing: partly becauſe it is too inconſequent and ridiculous to be affixed on a man ſo judicious, and learned; and partly becauſe there is no ſuch word reported from him by his Contracter <hi>Spanhemius.</hi> And then it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

               <p n="80">§. 80.

But this does not do the Dippers buſineſs, nor prove that Dr.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107492:106"/> 
                  <hi>Hammond</hi> ever denied, or intended by any thing he ſaid to deny, or imply a denyal of any's being baptized among the Ancients otherwiſe than by immerſion. The Doctor knew better things than ſo. For to grant that publick Baptiſm was adminiſtred by immerſion, doth not affirm that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm was ſo adminiſtred; to grant that Perſons in health were dipped, doth not affirm that Perſons in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſo baptized too. In ſhort, unleſs theſe two things can be made good, which yet never can be, firſt that none were ever baptized amongſt the ancients, but in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Baptiſterions</hi> (none in private Houſes, none in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, none in their Beds;) Secondly, that even in thoſe publick <hi>Baptiſterions</hi> none were ever baptized but by a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal immerſion, and that it did not ſuffice to ſome Perſons, and in ſome places, to have their Heads only dipped, all the Doctor's diſcourſe of the largeneſs of the ancient <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbethras</hi> makes nothing to the confirmation of the Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's ſuppoſition. It is one thing to talk of what is done in <hi>ordinary</hi> and common caſes, and another thing to talk of what is <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and but done upon ſpecial emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and the proof of the one is no diſproving of the other.</p>
               <p n="81">§ 81. Secondly, I anſwer, that whatever Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaid, either of the word <gap reason="foreign">

And this, if his publiſhed Writings did not declare it, I ſhould be able to make good out of his private. For taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he ſaid of theſe things, and foreſeeing what uſe would by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> be made of what he ſaid, I did by Letter advertiſe him thereof; and he again by Letter to me did not only clear his own diſcourſes of the ſtrict import of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> from giving any advantage to the Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but alſo lay down ſeveral grounds, whereon the Church proceeded to uſe ſprinkling inſtead of dipping.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107492:106"/> thought, to the ſatisfaction of the <hi>Reader,</hi> as well as to the vindication of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> I once had thought to have made ſo much of his Letters publick.

               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:107492:107"/>
               <p>Firſt (ſaith he) in the Story of Chriſts baptiſm, we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5. (it ſhould be <hi>v.</hi> 13.) <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> Jeſus came from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan</hi> unto <hi>John,</hi> to be baptized of him. <hi>And v. 16.</hi> And when he was baptized, he went up ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the water.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <q>The Learned <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the place, ſaith, Chriſt aſcended out of the water; therefore Chriſt was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> not by Sprinkling or pouring Water upon him, but by Immerſion, that is, by dipping or plunging in the water.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. To the Text I have already ſpoke, in <hi>ch.</hi> 10. I ſhall now therefore ſpeak to the Cardinal.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. And that <hi>Cardinal</hi> (who, no doubt, was learned enough to deſerve that Emphatical Title of <hi>the Learned;</hi> and from an Anabaptiſt, eſpecially when he ſeems to ſpeak for Dipping in Baptiſm) doth indeed make ſuch Collection, that becauſe of its being ſaid, that <hi>Jeſus ſtraightway went up out of the water,</hi> therefore he was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> not by Sprinkling, or pouring water upon him from above, but by dipping in, or bowing down his body. But this <hi>Learned mans</hi> aſſertion being founded on a reaſon, his word can be of no more weight than his reaſon is. But his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is none, as I have ſhewed in theſe Papers, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. Nor could all the Learning he had ever prove, from Chriſts aſcending <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ab aquâ</hi> (as <hi>Muſculus,</hi> the next Author that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> here cites, doth render it) <hi>from the water</hi> (as that is in the Original; which in his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>de aqua,</hi> in ours, <hi>out of the water</hi>) that Chriſt was baptized by a total immerſion. It follows therefore that his word is nothing alſo. And ſo with this I might diſmiſs him.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. But further, having conſulted that <hi>Author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the place here quoted, I find ſomething, not taken notice of by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> or thought fit by him to be ſlipped by, that makes the Cardinal ſeem not altogether ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory in his Concluſion, which is, that having ſaid, Jeſus was baptized by <hi>John, per immerſionem,</hi> that is, by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107492:107"/> he adds, <hi>ſeu ſubmiſſionem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris,</hi> which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> Engliſhes not,<note place="margin">Baptizatus autem Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus confeſtim aſcendit de aqua] Non ergo per aſperſionem aut deſuper effuſionem, ſed per im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſionem ſeu ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem corporis baptizatus eſt Jeſus in Jordane. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan,</hi> in Matth. <hi>3.16.</hi>
                  </note> unleſs plunging in the water be the Engliſh of it with him: but it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies only a bowing down of the body. And who knows but that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal might ſpeak thoſe words by way of Correction of, or explication to what went before, and intend only thereby, that he bowed down his body in order to the having of his <hi>head only</hi> dipped in water, which hath been ſince, if it were never before that, a way of baptizing. And if this be the meaning of the Phraſe, then the Cardinal having propoſed two ways, and having determined for neither, cannot be produced as a poſitive witneſs for either: unleſs by him, that will do as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath done, and leave what makes againſt him, out.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. But were it ſo, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> makes the Cardinal ſay, and that by <hi>ſubmiſſionem</hi> he meant nothing more, nor other than what he meant by <hi>immerſion</hi> (though thoſe words are far enough from being Synonymous,) yet it doth not follow, that it muſt be neceſſarily ſo with us too: unleſs there were a neceſſity of our conformity with Chriſt in all his Sacramental Circumſtances, which I think our Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts will not ſay we ſhould, no not in thoſe which concern Baptiſm. For then we muſt not be baptized till above thirty years of Age; we muſt be unmarried when baptized; we muſt be baptized no where but in a River, and that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt be <hi>Jordan:</hi> in which circumſtances yet ſome have been more zealous, than judicious imitators of him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it may be taken notice of, that by Baptiſm the learned <hi>Cardinal</hi> underſtood an <hi>Ablution.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>v.</hi> 5. of this Chapter, upon the word <hi>[Baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur]</hi> he ſaith, the old Greek word remained among the Latines in their Eccleſiaſtick Myſteries, and that it ought to have been <hi>abluebantur,</hi> and that <hi>John</hi> himſelf did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>miniſterium abluendi,</hi> and that the ſinners offered
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107492:108"/> themſelves, <hi>abluendos à Joanne, tanquam exterior ablutio eſſet quaedam profeſſio poenitentiae, &amp; mundae deinceps vitae ducendae,</hi> to be waſhed by <hi>John,</hi> as if the external waſhing were a kind of profeſſion of repentance and a new life thenceforth to be led. So that with him <hi>waſhing</hi> ſeems to have been the moſt material thing in <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm: and then no queſtion, but that where that is, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> will allow of a Baptiſm, though it be not performed by a total immerſion.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. From <hi>Cajetan</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> paſſeth on to <hi>Muſculus;</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>Muſculus</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. calls Baptiſm Dipping, and ſaith, 'the Parties baptized were <hi>dipped,</hi> not <hi>ſprinkled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But he telleth us not on what verſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor in what Page of that Volume he ſaith it. The diſcovery had ſaved me ſome time, and labour in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And what is the worſt of it, after all my pains in reading two and twenty pages <hi>in folio,</hi> with care to find the place, and all thoſe places where there ſeemed to be any probability of finding it, twice over, all the Return I can make upon my Inqueſt is this, <hi>Non eſt inventus,</hi> there is no ſuch place or paſſage in all that <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith on that Chapter, that I could find.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. This indeed there is, that he uſes the word <hi>tinctio</hi> for baptizing in ſeveral places.<note place="margin">Adumbrat enim ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna illa tinctio, &amp; my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica ablutio quae fit in corpore renovationem mentium &amp; ablutionem ſordium, &amp;c.

                  </note> But ſurely <hi>tinctio</hi> doth not ſignifie preciſely dipping, but wetting, or dying, be it what way it will that a thing is wetted or dyed; whether by dipping into, or pouring on, that which wetteth or dyeth. And I have ſhewed in theſe Papers, that as <hi>tingo</hi> is ſometimes put to ſignifie baptizing in general however performed, <hi>viz.</hi> when it ſtands alone: ſo it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put to ſignifie baptizing by Sprinkling or pouring on water in particular, and in oppoſition to dipping. His calling baptiſm then <hi>tinction,</hi> if that be it which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> means, no more proves his calling it dipping, than ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:107492:108"/>§. 12. But as for his ſaying, <hi>that the Parties baptized were dipped not ſprinkled,</hi> there is no ſuch thing ſaid by him there. And I cannot but wonder with what confidence Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould ſay any ſuch thing. Had I ſaid it, a crime would have been charged on me; which out of reſpect and honour to that Gentleman, becauſe a Gentleman, though unknown to me, I ſhall forbear ſo much as to name. All I ſhall ſay is, that Truth needs no Untruths to defend it: and that the Champion that goes about by ſuch ſupports to maintain a cauſe, rather ruines it, than upholds it. And thoſe of his Party may do well to take heed how they truſt his reports from other Authors, who hath ſo unbecoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſay no worſe, miſreported this. The beſt excuſe that I can make for him is, that it is not impoſſible, but that either himſelf, or his <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> might miſtake the place in writing, or that it might be amiſs ordered by the Compoſitor in the Printing (ſuch things very ordinarily happening to be:) and if that will any way ſalve his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as I wiſh it may, much good d'it him with it.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. But to go on, <q>A Second Scripture conſiderable is that of <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>And</hi> John <hi>was baptizing in</hi> Aenon <hi>near</hi> Salim (and the reaſon why he pitcht upon this place is given) <hi>becauſe there was much water there.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. To this Text I have already ſpoken in <hi>ch.</hi> 11. and ſo I think it needleſs to ſay any thing farther here. But—</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. <q>
                     <hi>Piſcator</hi> upon the place (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) ſays <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="16">§. 16. Not to trouble Mr. <hi>D.</hi> with asking him, how the body of a man can be plunged (which is Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s word, and none of <hi>Piſcators</hi>) in the River, whilſt he is ſtanding in it, I ſhall acknowledge <hi>Piſcators</hi> words to be much to

We will ſuppoſe the water, or waters deep enough for a man to be dipped in; and that it was <hi>John</hi>'s way to baptize by dipping. But Chriſts aſcending out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proves it not: as I have ſhewed, <hi>ch.</hi> 10.

But that no ſuch thing is here to be ſeen, I ſhall make ſufficiently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. And ſo this place, on that ſuppoſition, is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="26">§. 26. Thirdly, This place is an intimation, that the uſe for the Miniſter to ſprinkle (not as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> renders it <hi>to caſt a few drops</hi> only <hi>on</hi>) the Body or Head was formerly in being. Firſt, becauſe he calls it <hi>an uſe;</hi> and that muſt

And ſecondly, becauſe he ſaith (not as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> renders him) the uſe is, but <hi>invaluit uſus,</hi> it was grown to be an uſe, or the uſe that was begun was grown ſtrong, and had gained confirmation by cuſtome, for the Miniſter to baptize by ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. Fourthly, Was Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> againſt ſprinkling in Baptiſm, by any thing that appears in this place? Far be it from any to think ſo. It had been more ingenuous in Mr. <hi>D.</hi> to have given us the reſt that follows: wherein Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks as much to the purpoſe in vindication of ſprinkling, as any Rhantiſt, as ſome call thoſe that are for baptizing by ſprinkling, would deſire. Which becauſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has not done, as well for vindication of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as the truth, I will do it.</p>

                  </note> ought not to be of that eſteem with us, as that for it we ſhould rend the Church, or trouble it with Brawls. Truly for the Ceremony of Baptiſm it ſelf, in as much as it was delivered to us by Chriſt, we ought to fight to the death an hundred times over, rather than ſuffer it to be taken away from us. But ſeeing that in the Symbol of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have teſtimony as well of our waſhing, as of our new life: Seeing that in the water, as in a Looking-glaſs, Chriſt repreſents unto us his Blood, that from thence we may ſeek our cleanſing: ſeeing that he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we are faſhioned again by his Spirit, that being dead to ſin we may live to righteouſneſs; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we want nothing which can make for the ſubſtance of Baptiſm.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:107492:111"/> Wherefore from the beginning the Church took free liberty to it ſelf, ſave in this ſubſtance, to have rites a little unlike. For ſome dipped thrice, but ſome only once: wherefore we have no reaſon in things of not ſo great neceſſity to be too moroſe, ſo that adventitious pomps do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the plain inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>O that our Dippers would but be ſo tender as not to rend and trouble the Church about ſo little a difference as this is. Sure they would not be ſo ſtiff about it, if they did not think, that whileſt we have not the Ceremony of dipping, we want ſomething that is of the ſubſtance of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is quite contrary to the judgment of their here-appealed-unto witneſs, Mr. <hi>Calvin:</hi> who looks upon it as one of thoſe things which are not ſo neceſſary; and thinks that the preſent Church may, as the Primitive Church did, and (mark that) <hi>from the beginning</hi> allow it ſelf ſome liberty in the uſe of ſeveral, not greatly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rites and Ceremonies.</p>

Now becauſe none are buried but dead men, from this very thing that we are buried in Baptiſm, we are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to Christ buried, or when he was buried.</q>

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:107492:111"/>§. 31. To the Text, I anſwer, Firſt, That it is plain by it, that there was ſuch a cuſtome in thoſe days, as to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by immerſion, which carried a very ſenſible ſhew of a Burial, and a Reſurrection. But the Negative cannot be thence concluded, that there was no other way of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, but that. Nor is it probable there was no other way: Firſt, becauſe there are other Texts of Scripture, which allude to ſprinkling in Baptiſm, as this cloth to dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And the like Collection muſt be allowed to be made from the one, that is made from the other. Secondly, becauſe there may be, and is a baptiſmal repreſentation made of a burial, and of a Reſurrection, not only in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial merſation, but in aſperſion or affuſion of water, as well as in immerſion, as we ſhall more at large ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="32">§. 32. And now to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> I anſwer, that not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Book by me to examine, I muſt ſtand to the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s ingenuity for the Truth of the Quotation; which yet if truly made, is not much to the <hi>Quoter</hi>'s advantage. All that I can find in it to the purpoſe, is in theſe words. [<hi>He who is baptized,</hi> is <hi>put under the water, and by this carries a ſimilitude of him that is buried.</hi>] But what makes this againſt ſprinkling? or what more for dipping, than for ſprinkling? He that is dipped is put under the water. True: And where is he put that is ſprinkled? Above it? That were a new faſhion of baptizing indeed. In ſhort, he that is ſprinkled, as well as he that is dipped, is put under the water, and the water's falling upon him that is ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, fairly repreſents the Earth's falling upon him that is buried; and ſo in ſprinkling, as well as in dipping, there is a ſimilitude of a burial, and by the one as well as by the other, we may be ſaid to be buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm into Death. And ſo the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s teſtimony might have been ſpared, unleſs to fill up room, and make a ſhew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every whit as much for us, as it is for them that are againſt us.</p>
               <p n="33">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:107492:112"/>§. 33. If it be replied, that by putting under water the <hi>Cardinal</hi> meant ſuch a putting under water as is done in a total immerſion, and not by affuſion or aſperſion; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; it may be, or may not be ſo, for ought I know. But however, that affirmative, that he that is put ſo under the water carries a ſimilitude of a burial, doth not imply a negative of contrary in it, that none carries a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a burial, but he that is ſo put under the water. That repreſentation is made both ways, though in the one it is more lively than in the other. And ſo the paſſage is impertinent, and proves nothing.</p>
               <p n="34">§. 34. <hi>Keckerman</hi> (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) in his <hi>Syſt. Theol. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. ſays, <q>That Immerſion, not Aſperſion, was the first Inſtitution of Baptiſm, as it doth plainly appear from Rom. <hi>6.3.</hi>

He tells us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that not only the words, but form of Baptiſm do intimate a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to be made of the Burial of Chriſt; the total immerſing of the Body ſo far under the water, as to be for a while covered thereby from ſight, bearing a certain Image (as he ſaith) of that Burial, which is given to the Dead: and its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again from under the water, bearing an Image or ſhew of Chriſt's riſing again. And this we freely grant, where it is ſo adminiſtred. But as he doth not ſay, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we grant, that it is not ſignified any other way, yea we ſhew the contrary in theſe Papers. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, or rather certain, that ſuch a way of baptizing was in uſe among the <hi>Romans,</hi> in as much as the Apoſtle alludes thereto, as a thing known amongſt them; and makes Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences there-from for the inſtructing of them. But that is not the queſtion in hand: but whether that was the <hi>only</hi> way, not there only, but throughout the whole Chriſtian World. If it were not ſo, then can no Argument thence be drawn to the evacuating of other ways of baptizing. And if it were ſo, yet ſtill, unleſs the Church had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to vary at any time from what was before time, in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107492:114"/> accidentals and circumſtantials of worſhip, other ways of baptizing inſtituted and approved of by the Church, will be lawful.</p>
               <p n="47">§. 47. And as for <hi>Davenant,</hi> he ſaith not a word tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove dipping to have been <hi>the (i. e.</hi> the only) Rite in Chriſt's time: but rather the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For having ſaid, that in Baptiſm, when the Party baptized is let down into the water, thereby is deſigned the burial of the Body of ſins, or the old <hi>Adam;</hi> as the Reſurrection, when he is brought out; he adds this as a reaſon: <hi>In veteri enim Eccleſia non tingebant ſolummodo, ſed in aquam immergebant cos, quos baptizabant.</hi> For in the ancient Church they did not only tinge, but immerſe into water, thoſe whom they baptized. I have ſhewed that <hi>tingo,</hi> though when it is ſet alone, it is often put to ſignifie baptizing in general, whether by dipping or ſprinkling, yet when it is ſet in oppoſition to dipping, it ſignifies only ſprinkling, or ſome other way of baptizing diſtinct from dipping. So then, as this Author ſpeaks not at all of <hi>Chriſt's time</hi> in particular, but only of the ancient Church in general, ſo what he ſpeaks of that time, reaches as well to ſprinkling, as to dipping, and aſſerts the antiquity of the one, as well as of the other. <hi>Non tingebant ſolummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, ſed immergebant,</hi> ſignifies plainly, that they did both <hi>tingere</hi> and <hi>immergere.</hi> And if both were Rites in that time, then was not only one of them, namely dipping, <hi>the, i. e.</hi> the only Rite in that time: And ſo Mr. <hi>D.</hi> gains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his cauſe by the Teſtimony of this no leſs learned, than honourable Father of our Church.</p>
               <p n="48">§. 48. After this triumvirate of learned Men follows a Man, who alone was a <hi>triumvir</hi> in Learnirg, <q>
                     <hi>Tilenus,</hi> (a learned Proteſtant Writer, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf ſtiles him) and he in his Diſputation, <hi>p.</hi> 886, 889, 890. gives, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us a moſt remarkable teſtimony in the caſe. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſaith he, is the firſt Sacrament of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inſtituted by Chriſt, in which with a moſt pat and exact Analogy between the ſign and the thing ſignified,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107492:115"/> thoſe that are in Covenant are by the Miniſter waſhed in Water. The outward Rite in Baptiſm is three-fold; 1. Immerſion into the Water. 2. Abiding under the water. 3. Reſurrection out of the water. The form of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Internal and Eſſential, is no other than the Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportion, which the ſigns keep with the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thereby. For the properties of water in waſhing away the defilements of the Body, do in a moſt ſuitable ſimilitude ſet forth the efficacy of Chriſt's blood in blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of ſin; ſo dipping into the Water doth in a moſt lively ſimilitude ſet forth the mortification of the old man; and riſing out of the Water, the vivification of the New. The ſame plunging into the Water, holds forth to us that horrible gulf of Divine Juſtice, in which Chriſt for our ſins ſake (which he took upon him) was for a while in a manner ſwallowed up. Abiding under water, how little a while ſoever, denotes his deſcent into Hell, even the very deepeſt of lifeleſneſs, while lying in the ſealed and guarded Sepulcher, he was accounted as one dead. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Water, holds out to us a lively ſimilitude of that Conqueſt, which this Dead man got over Death, which he vanquiſhed in his own Den, (as it were) that is the Grave. In like manner therefore (ſaith he) it is meet that we being baptized into his death, and buried with him, ſhould alſo riſe with him, and ſo go on in newneſs of life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.12.</q>

But how Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will clear himſelf from diſingenuity in the caſe, when he ſo cries up <hi>Tilenus,</hi> and his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> as being for them, and yet conceals, what he could not but know, that he is one of the moſt poſitive and clear witneſſes for us that ever writ, I leave it to himſelf to conſider.

                  </note> and without taking notice of what he might have obſerved by the way in the Twelfth <hi>Theſis,</hi> that ſpeaking of the action and external Rites belonging to the external part of Baptiſm, he names them <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> with an addition of words, and appearing out of the water.

               <p n="52">§. 52. This is indeed a moſt remarkable Teſtimony in the caſe. And I thank Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for it: which probably elſe I ſhould not have enquired after. But why Mr. <hi>D.</hi> concealed thus much of it from us, when he gave us the reſt, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can better declare, than I divine. In the mean time the Reader may be pleaſed to take notice of theſe remarks in it. (1.) That the Etymology of the word ſignifies <hi>dipping</hi> and alſo <hi>ſprinkling.</hi> (2.) That he ſaith, that dipping was formerly <hi>more</hi> uſual than ſprinkling; but <hi>not</hi> that it <hi>only</hi> was uſual. (3.) That this circumſtance doth not pertain to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of baptiſm. (4.) That the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the Sacrament is kept no leſs in ſprinkling, than in dipping. (5.) That each Rite is ſignified by the word, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:107492:116"/> (6.) That by the Law of charity and neceſſity the uſe of either of them (and then ſprinkling as well as dipping) may be retained in the Church. A remarkable Teſtimony indeed, this, eſpecially from an Author quoted againſt us by an Anabaptiſt.</p>
               <p n="53">§. 53. After this Mr. <hi>D.</hi> claps two <hi>Theſes</hi> more (<hi>viz.</hi> the 32. and 34.) to the reſt, ſo ſtill, as if all had been one continued diſcourſe, and as if that learned Writer had made one long continued harangue of dipping in Baptiſm, and ſpoken nothing between of any thing elſe. But becauſe what follows, conſiſts only in a fair declaration of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between dipping into water, continuing under it, and coming up again out of it, and things ſaid by him to be ſignified by thoſe actions, which are no matter of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between us and the Anabaptiſts: therefore I forbear to tranſcribe any further: but leave the Reader to make his eſtimate of this Teſtimony, and of the Quoter of it.</p>
               <p n="54">§. 54. Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> was a <hi>Commentator,</hi> as well as a <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Writer, and upon that account he is brought in by the <hi>Major</hi> in this Squadron alſo, and charging us thus, Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> in his <hi>Annotat.</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>[Buried with him in Baptiſm unto death.]</hi> 
                  <q>Baptiſm, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> is an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only of thy death with Chriſt, which is the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſin, but alſo of thy Burial with him, which is a perpetual mortification, or abiding under that death. He alludes to the manner in which Baptiſm was then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, which was to plunge them in the water; the plunging of them into water, which were baptized, was a ſign of their death and Burial with Chriſt. So Mr. <hi>D.</hi> reports him.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="55">§. 55. His words are, He alludes to the manner in which baptiſm was then adminiſtred, which was to ſtrip them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whom they baptized, and plunge them in the water; after which they put on new garments: whence thoſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſpeaking uſed in Scripture, to <hi>put on Chriſt, to put off the old man,</hi> and <hi>put on the new, Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.11. and 3.9, 10. And he addes in the Margin, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107492:117"/> plunging of them into the water which were baptized, was a ſign of their death, and burial with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="56">§. 56. To this I anſwer, Firſt, it is not to be doubted, but that putting wholly under the water was one manner of baptizing then uſed. But if in calling it <hi>the manner,</hi> it be meant, it was <hi>the only manner,</hi> this is eaſilier ſaid, than proved; and better proof muſt be given of it, than hath yet appeared, before it be conſented unto. Not Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi>'s bare word, though a very worthy and learned Perſon he were, hath authority enough for that, whileſt there are ſo many, and ſtrong preſumptions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p n="57">§. 57. Secondly, though in that place, and at that time, and by that Apoſtle, Baptiſm by a total dipping were the only baptiſm that were uſed, yet who can ſay, but that at another time, and in another place, and by the ſame, or ſome other Apoſtle, there was a baptizing by ſprinkling, pouring on of water, or partial merſation? We have theſe other ways of baptizing in the Church; and in the Church they have anciently been had; and their original cannot be ſhewn; and therefore we have reaſon to believe them to have been from the beginning; though as being not the general way, which acknowledgedly was dipping, and as being adminiſtred but in caſes of neceſſity, there appear not ſo many, nor ſo bright inſtances of them; and it is ſome matter of difficulty to trace them particularly up ſo high.</p>
               <p n="58">§ 58. Thirdly, I wonder Mr. <hi>D.</hi> did not as well mention their <hi>stripping</hi> too, as their <hi>dipping.</hi> If I might gueſs, it ſhould be this, that he was loth it ſhould be known, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practice of the Dippers were in any thing different from the Primitive. But that it moſt apparently is. For in the Primitive times they were dipped <hi>naked,</hi> as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s doth declare: but, as far as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, thoſe whom our Dippers now baptize, are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked when dipped, but have ſome Garment on. And this to avoid indecency. Now if in one thing, to avoid inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107492:117"/> they may vary from the Primitive practice (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the manner of baptizing among the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes its obligations) Why may not we, for the ſame end, vary from it in another? I ſhall not need to add, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the baptized did put on <hi>new Garments</hi> after their baptizing, as Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> ſaith, and for the reaſons mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Leigh.</hi> But I hear nothing of that practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Dippers: nor any thing but that the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they did put off before their baptizing, they do put on again after their baptiſm. Which is another dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in theirs, from the Primitive way. And ſince the Primitive Saints did wholly ſtrip themſelves, to ſignifie that they did wholly put off the old Man, as concerning their former converſation; they ſhould be afraid leſt their not ſtripping themſelves wholly, ſhould ſignifie, that they did put off the old Man not wholly, but in part; and their putting on again the ſame Clothes they had on before, ſhould ſignifie their being wholly the ſame that they were before. Thoſe that ſtand ſo nicely upon it to be in all punctilio's of Rites conform to the Apoſtolick and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive practice, ſhould, methinks, think of theſe things: for others, that are not ſo ſcrupulous about them, there is not the like neceſſity of obſervation of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Aſſembly Divines,</hi> who bring up the Rere of this Squadron of <hi>Commentators,</hi> do (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) in their Annotations upon the place, ſay, <q>That in this phraſe the Apoſtle ſeems to allude to the ancient manner of baptizing, which was to dip the Parties unbaptized, and as it were to bury them under water for a while, and then to raiſe them up again out of it, to repreſent the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the old Man, and our Reſurrection to Newneſs of Life.</q> The like ſaith <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Diodate</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p n="59">§. 59. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> here fairly reports them; only in ſtead of thoſe words <hi>[to raiſe them up again]</hi> the <hi>Divines</hi> have [to <hi>draw them out of it,</hi> and <hi>lift them up,</hi>] which change why he made I cannot diſcern: unleſs it were this;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107492:118"/> That he feared thoſe words <hi>[to draw out, and lift up]</hi> ſhould import, that the Perſons then baptized were ſuch as were capable of being ſo <hi>drawn</hi> and <hi>lifted;</hi> and ſo make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der think that <hi>Infants,</hi> the propereſt perſons for ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be done to (it being no eaſie thing to imagine how they could be performed to perſons that were Adult; nor did I ever, to my remembrance, in any ancient Author read of any ſuch action done to them) <hi>were then baptized:</hi> and then this teſtimony would do as much hurt to his cauſe one way, whilſt it proved <hi>Infants Baptiſm</hi> as old as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it did it good another way, whileſt it aſſerted their Baptiſm to have been by dipping. And perhaps he feared too, that the <hi>lifting up</hi> might make ſome think, that the uſe of <hi>God-fathers</hi> (the things ſo horribly decried by the Men of his way) was Primitive too: that work <hi>[levare de fonte]</hi> to lift up out of, or from the Font, being ſo proper to the God-fathers, as that it is made the common Phraſe to import ones being a God-father. Thus much to him.</p>
               <p n="60">§. 60. Now to his <hi>Authors,</hi> I ſay the ſame that I ſaid to Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> that if by thoſe words <hi>[the ancient manner]</hi> they meant only, that it was, <hi>a way,</hi> or <hi>one manner,</hi> and that the moſt <hi>general way</hi> and manner ſo to baptize, I ſhall grant it. But if they mean, that it was <hi>the only way, and manner,</hi> then their word ſignifies no more with me, than the ground, which they give for it, amounts unto, which is none at all. Now that being none, their word is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="61">§. 61. And the ſame I ſay to <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Diodate,</hi> if they ſo ſay, as the Aſſembly Divines have ſaid. Though I rather think it was the <hi>Aſſembly Divines,</hi> that ſaid the like to them, than they to the Aſſembly Divines, as being and writing before them. But however it were, to the ſame, or the like Argument, the ſame, or the like Anſwer is to be returned.</p>
               <p n="62">§. 62. And thus I have alſo cleared the Field of this Squadron of <hi>Commentators.</hi> The third and laſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts

By the Perſons being put into water, was lively repreſented the putting off the body of the ſins of the Fleſh, and being waſhed from the filth and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. By his being under it, which is a kind of Burial into water, his entring into a ſtate of Death or Mortification; like as Chriſt remained for ſome time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtate or power of Death; therefore it is ſaid, As many as are baptized into Chriſt, are baptized into his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107492:119"/> Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then by his emerſion or riſing up out of the water, is ſignified his entring upon the new courſe of life, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, ſo we ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>D.</hi> reports him.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. But for all this, (1.) that Doctor is no <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;</hi> nor againſt <hi>sprinkling</hi> in Baptiſm. For he doth not ſay that immerging was abſolutely the conſtant, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal cuſtom of thoſe times, but, with a reſtriction, <hi>almost</hi> the conſtant, and univerſal cuſtom: that is, it was not the conſtant, nor the univerſal cuſtome, but yet very much in uſe, the common practice of thoſe times, as he after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 321. Which is a clear confeſſion of ſome other way of baptizing then in uſe, beſides immerging, though not ſo much in uſe as that.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Secondly, after the Doctor's diſcourſe of the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Perſons being put under, and being under the water, and riſing up out of it, (which is all that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> takes notice of, and ſtops, when he comes at the end of it) the Doctor goes on to ſpeak of <hi>Sprinkling:</hi> and ſaith,— But though by reaſon of the more eminent ſignification of theſe things, immerſion was the common practice in thoſe days, and therefore they earneſtly urged it, and pleaded for it, yet did they not hold ſprinkling to be <hi>unlawful;</hi> eſpecially in caſes of neceſſity, of weakneſs, danger of death, or where conveniency of immerging could not be had; in theſe and ſuch like caſes <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> does not only allow,<note place="margin">Ep. <hi>76.</hi> ad Magn. p. <hi>153.</hi>
                  </note> but plead for it, and that in a diſcourſe on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when the queſtion concerning it was put to him. Upon <hi>this account</hi> it is, that immerſion is generally diſuſed in theſe parts of the World, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſucceeded in its room, becauſe the tender bodies of moſt Infants (the only Perſons now baptized) could not be put under water in the cold Northern Climats, without apparent prejudice to their health, if not their lives: and therefore in this, as in other caſes, God requires <hi>mercy</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107492:119"/> rather than Sacrifice, eſpecially conſidering, that the main ends of Baptiſm are attained this way, and the Myſtical effects of it as truly, though not ſo plainly and ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented by Sprinkling, as by putting the body under water.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. In which diſcourſe of his theſe remarks are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that 'tis loſs, I fear, of time, to take notice of them to the Reader. (1.) That the practice of dipping, was <hi>but almoſt,</hi> and was <hi>not abſolutely</hi> univerſal in the Primitive times. (2.) That <hi>ſprinkling</hi> was <hi>not</hi> then held <hi>unlawful.</hi> (3.) That Sprinkling was eſpecially allowed in caſes of <hi>neceſſity, weakneſs, danger of death,</hi> or <hi>want of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> for immerging. (4.) That in this caſe God requires mercy, rather than Sacrifice. (5) That the <hi>main ends</hi> of baptiſm are this way obtained. (6.) That the Myſtical effects of it are as truly repreſented this way, as by dipping, though not ſo plainly. So grave a witneſs was Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> againſt Sprinkling in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> is the next that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> makes to appear in this cauſe. And he (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) in his <hi>Apologie,</hi> p. 308. <q>brings the <hi>Council of Wormes</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the manner of Baptiſm thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the dipping into the water is the going down into Hell (or the Grave) and that the coming out of the water is the Reſurrection.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. But B. <hi>Jewel</hi> hath nothing of this in his <hi>Apology,</hi> which I read all over, to find it. Miſſing it there, I ſought for it in <hi>Caranzas Epitome</hi> of the Councils: but that hath nothing of it neither. Then I ſearched the <hi>Councils at large</hi> in <hi>Surius,</hi> and there I found what that Council ſaid in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this matter; as alſo at laſt in B. <hi>Jewels Defenſe</hi> of his Apology, part. 2. pag. not 308, but yet 309 And it is plain to every man, that has but a drachm of brains in his Skull, that the Council there doth not <hi>determine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of Baptiſm, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would make the <hi>B.</hi> ſay it doth, but only <hi>declareth the meaning</hi> of that way of Baptizing, when perſons are dipped, namely that going into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſents going down into a grave, or a burial, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107492:120"/> that coming out of the water repreſents a coming out of the grave, or a reſurrection. The words of the Council as they are in <hi>Surius,</hi> are theſe, <hi>Et nè fortè cuiquam ſit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium hujus ſimplex myſterium Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi>

                  <hi>videat in eo mortem &amp; reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionem Chriſti ſignificari.

So no <hi>determination</hi> here of the <hi>manner</hi> of Baptiſm to be by dipping, but only a <hi>declaration</hi> of the <hi>meaning</hi> of that Ceremony, when the perſon baptized is dipped.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Now to requite Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for his Quotation out of B. <hi>Jewel,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Next to B. <hi>Jewel</hi> ſucceeds Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> 
                  <q>And (ſaith Mr. <hi>D.</hi>) moſt remarkable is the Teſtimony Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:107492:120"/> himſelf gives to this Truth, wherein he alſo owns the changing of the Ceremony in his third Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <q>§. 9. <hi>Quoad modum,</hi> To the manner, ſaith he, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly confeſſed by us to the Anabaptiſts (as our <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi> declare) that in the Apoſtles time the Baptized were dipped over head in water; and that this ſignifieth their profeſſion both of believing the Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, and of their own preſent renouncing the world, and fleſh, or dying to ſin, and living to Chriſt, or riſing again to newneſs of life, or being buried and riſen again with Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expoundeth in the forecited Texts of <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And though (ſaith he) we have thought it lawful to diſuſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dipping, and to uſe leſs water; yet we preſume not to change the uſe and ſignification of it. So then he that ſignally profeſſeth to die, and riſe again in Baptiſm with Chriſt, doth ſignally profeſs ſaving Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but this do all they that are baptized according to the Apoſtles practice.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. I anſwer, that I ſee nothing in this Teſtimony that merits ſo triumphant a Remark to be ſet upon it, for any advantage that is given to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Cauſe by it. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth that in the Apoſtles time the baptized were dipped over <hi>head</hi> in water, But he doth not confeſs that they were dipped over <hi>Body</hi> too. Plainly, that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth amounts but to a partial merſation of the <hi>head,</hi> and doth not neceſſarily imply a total immerſion of the <hi>Body;</hi> unleſs it were impoſſible for a man to have his <hi>head</hi> dipped in water, except his whole <hi>body</hi> were dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into it alſo. And if that will do Mr. <hi>D.</hi> any ſervice, much good d'it him with his Teſtimony. The like we have ſhewn in theſe Papers from St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom, &amp;c.</hi> But that will not do the Dippers buſineſs; whom nothing will ſerve, but a total Judaical immerſion of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And the change Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of I ſuppoſe to be from this partial dipping, into ſprinkling, which granted ſignifies nothing.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:107492:121"/>§. 11. But ſuppoſe he meant, what he ſaid, of a total immerſion, then I judge his ſenſe was, that generally the baptized were in the Apoſtles time dipped over head in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not <hi>univerſally;</hi> that <hi>moſt</hi> were <hi>ſo</hi> baptized, not that <hi>none</hi> were baptized <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> And then his Confeſſion will neither hurt himſelf nor us.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But if he meant more than ſo, then ſince he hath at the ſame time declared himſelf to have thought it lawful to difuſe the, <hi>i. e.</hi> that manner of Dipping, and to uſe leſs water, it is plain he thought the Church not to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that Apoſtolical practice to an univerſal obſervance thereof through all ſucceſſions of Ages, but to have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make alteration even in Sacramentals, ſo they were but Circumſtantial, and not Eſſential parts of Worſhip. And ſo the producing of his Teſtimony ſeems to be but a wreſting of his words to ſignifie what was not in his mind: which whether it be fair or no, I leave to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf to conſider.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. If I have not ſpoken Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s mind, or have not ſpoken it unto his mind, he is alive, of age, and ability to anſwer for himſelf. And I rather wiſh he would be pleaſed to do it himſelf, who can do it infinitely better, than I dare preſume my ſelf able to do.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. <q>The next that we are to encounter, is <hi>Daillé,</hi> on the Fathers, who (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us) <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 148. ſaith, That it was a Cuſtom heretofore in the Ancient Church, to plunge thoſe they baptized, over Head and Ears in the Water;<note place="margin">
                        <p>There is ſome little miſtake in theſe quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Mr. <hi>Daille</hi>'s Margent thus.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tertul. l. de Cor. Mil. c.</hi> 3. Cyprian. <hi>Ep.</hi> 76. <hi>p.</hi> 211. <hi>Edit. Pamel.</hi> Epiphan. <hi>Pan. Haer.</hi> 30. <hi>p.</hi> 128. Caſſand. <hi>l. de Bapt. Inſ. p.</hi> 693.</p>
                     </note> as, <hi>ſaith he, Tertullian</hi> (in his Third Book, <hi>De Cor. Mil.) Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> (in his ſeventh <hi>Ep. p.</hi> 211.) <hi>Epiphanius, Pan.</hi> (30. <hi>p.</hi> 128.) and others teſtifie. And this, ſaith he, is ſtill the practice both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Church at this day; as <hi>Caſſander De Bapt. (p.</hi> 193.) And yet, ſaith he, notwithſtanding, this Cuſtom, which is both ſo ancient,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107492:121"/> and ſo univerſal, is now aboliſhed by the Church of <hi>Reme;</hi> and this is the reaſon (ſaith he) that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Latines</hi> are not rightly and duly baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not wont to uſe this Ancient Ceremony in their Baptiſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. Either Mr. <hi>D.</hi> miſunderſtands Mr. <hi>Daille:</hi> or Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> miſtook the matter: Poſſibly both may be true. Firſt, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> might miſunderſtand <hi>Daille.</hi> For he might think <hi>Daille</hi> meant, that Dipping was the <hi>only</hi> cuſtom in the Ancient Church. But <hi>Daille</hi> doth not ſay ſo. He only ſaith it was <hi>a cuſtom,</hi> but he doth not ſay it was <hi>the only</hi> cuſtom. And 'tis true: <hi>a cuſtom</hi> it was ſo to baptize heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons; but it was not <hi>the</hi> cuſtom ſo to baptize all Perſons, for <hi>Clinicks</hi> were baptized in their Beds. Now for Mr. <hi>D.</hi> from an expreſſion of <hi>a cuſtom,</hi> that is, one cuſtome, to conclude for <hi>the</hi> cuſtom, that is, the only cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, is, as I humbly conceive, a miſunderſtanding.</p>
               <p n="16">§. 16. But ſecondly, if that were Mr. <hi>Daille</hi>'s meaning, as it may ſeem probable by his after words, when he ſaith,— <hi>this cuſtom which is both ſo ancient, and ſo univerſal, is now aboliſhed</hi> — then, yet under correction, I ſay, that great Man herein ſhewed himſelf to be but Man, and liable, like other inferiour mortals, to miſtake. For though the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was ſo <hi>ancient</hi> as to reach up to the Primitive times, yet it was not ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> as to extend to all Perſons in all, either of the ancient, or later times, as, I think, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly demonſtrated in theſe Papers. And perhaps the conſideration hereof was the reaſon why that great Man did not ſpeak poſitively in the caſe, and ſay abſolutely, that it was <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> cuſtom of <hi>the Ancient</hi> Church, but in a modified ſtrain, <hi>ſo ancient,</hi> and <hi>ſo univerſal, i. e.</hi> ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as to have been in the Primitive, and ſo univerſal as ſtill to be in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Church. A great piece of matter.</p>
               <p n="17">§. 17. But after all this, it may not be amiſs to make ſome few further Remarks on this Quotation. As Firſt, that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> leaves our after theſe words <hi>[and others
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107492:122"/> teſtifie]</hi> theſe which follow, [<hi>And indeed they plunged them thus three times: as the ſame</hi> Tertullian <hi>and St.</hi> Hierom <hi>both inform us</hi>] But why left he out this paſſage? Let the Reader judge. He eſpied in Mr. <hi>Daille</hi>'s Margent, where St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s teſtimony was referred to, theſe words at length, and not in figures, <hi>[In lavacro ter caput mergitare]</hi> by which it is plain, that this plunging <hi>over head and ears,</hi> at leaſt as far as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> gives teſtimony to it, was but of the <hi>whole Head,</hi> and not of the <hi>whole Body.</hi> Now that, had it been put in, would have ſpoiled all. For that would have proved but a partial merſation: and then it would have been no proof of a total immerſion; and ſo have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified nothing to the purpoſe, that by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> it was quoted for.</p>
               <p n="18">§. 18. Secondly, whereas Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> ſaith, that this is ſtill the practice both of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Church, even at this very day, I am not ſo well skilled in the preſent Rites of thoſe Churches, as peremptorily to contradict him. Yet that it hath been univerſally the practice of both thoſe Churches from the firſt to this day to baptize at all times by a total immerſion, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it. And that the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Church at leaſt hath formerly, if it do not at this day baptize by pouring of water on the baptized, I have ſhewed in theſe Papers. <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. Thirdly, after thoſe words, wherewith Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> concludes, <hi>[in their baptiſm]</hi> Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> adds <hi>[which, they ſay, is expreſly injoyned them in the Canons of Joannes Metropolitanus, whom they hold to have been a Prophet.]</hi> But why did not Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> add this? The Reader may eaſily conjecture the reaſon of it: even becauſe the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> did ground their cuſtom, for non-obſervance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſay that the <hi>Latines</hi> are not rightly and duly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not on the Word of God, but on the Canons of a Man, one <hi>Joannes Metropolitanus.</hi> Now to make it a Humane Inſtitution, or the Inſtitution of a Man, of whoſe Divine Inſpiration, and to ſuch purpoſe too as to give
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107492:122"/> Laws to the Church in the name of God, we have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance, would not do the Total Dippers buſineſs, who urge the univerſal obſervation of their Baptiſmal Rite, on no leſs an Authority, than that of a Divine command: and ſo Mr. <hi>D.</hi> wiſely let it alone. But others may obſerve it, and make of it what uſe they can.</p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. Fourthly, whereas Mr. <hi>Daille,</hi> and from him Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſaith, this is the reaſon that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Latines</hi> are not rightly and duly baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not wont to uſe this ancient Ceremony; it may be noted, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> (even taken according to what is here ſaid of them) do not charge the <hi>Latines</hi> with not being baptized at all, but with not being <hi>rightly,</hi> and <hi>duly</hi> baptized. This then is as clear an intimation of their allowing of the Baptiſm of the <hi>Latines,</hi> for ſubſtance, and granting that it is a Baptiſm, as it is of their diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it for circumſtance, and denying it to be rightly and duly performed. For he that ſays a Man is not rightly baptized, grants him baptized, whilſt he denies his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to have been rightly adminiſtred. For there can be no right or wrong, no due or undue baptiſm, where there is no baptizing at all. <hi>Sublato ſubjecto tollitur proprietas.</hi> And ſo this part of the Teſtimony clearly deſtroys that which it was produced to prove: and makes the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> witneſs to the truth of a Baptiſm amongſt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:</hi> whereas the contrary was deſigned by their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which I wonder Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> did not ſee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and for the ſake thereof paſs that by.</p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. Laſtly, whereas Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> ſaith, this cuſtom is now aboliſhed by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I ask what he means by <hi>Aboliſhing.</hi> If he ſay, the <hi>ceſſation</hi> of it by vertue of any Canonical Decree of that Church, then I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the <hi>Council,</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> by which its abolition was decreed; and be of opinion, till I ſee the contrary, that none ſuch will be produced. If by <hi>Aboliſhing</hi> he mean <hi>Diſuſing,</hi> then I grant, that in that ſenſe this cuſtom was indeed that aboliſhed, when that Author writ. But I muſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107492:123"/> ſay withal that it was not then firſt aboliſhed, but long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and that the beginning of ſuch its abolition is like the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> undiſcoverable: the cuſtom growing by inſenſible degrees from being at firſt almoſt univerſal, to become at laſt almoſt quite out of uſe, if yet at all it be uſed in that Church. So little griſt is by this Teſtimony brought to the Anabaptiſts mill.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. Well, admit this: it follows not, Firſt, that all that were baptized in flouds and fountains, were totally immerſed into them: they might be but <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> or but <hi>partially dipped</hi> in floud or fountain.</p>
               <p n="24">§. 24. Secondly, it follows not hence, that if <hi>any</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were totally immerſed, <hi>all</hi> were ſo. The expreſſion is but <hi>Indefinite,</hi> and not <hi>

The like alſo, as you'l here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after find, <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus,</hi> the two <hi>French</hi> Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, did in the Fifth Century, baptize multitudes in the River <hi>Allin</hi> near <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="27">§. 27. Grant all this, and what then? Then it follows, that 'tis probable that ſome were baptized in <hi>England</hi> in two ſeveral Centuries, by immerſion: becauſe many were baptized in <hi>Rivers.</hi> Yet I ſay 'tis but probable, not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; unleſs appearing from other evidence: becauſe a man may be baptized in a River, without being totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed into it. And in that multitudes are ſaid to have been baptized in thoſe Rivers, it makes it the more probable, that the baptiſm was not by a total immerſion; becauſe the labour and time was more in baptizing ſo, than otherwiſe; and when the Baptizer was but one, or but a few; and the Perſons to be baptized many, reaſon would prompt, that the more compendious and leſs troubleſome way ſhould be taken; and that was ſprinkling, pouring on of water, or partial merſation into it.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. And if there were no Fonts, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> notes, then there was the more reaſon they ſhould go to Rivers. Though their going to Rivers does not prove there were no Fonts. For where many were to be baptized, Fonts, unleſs of large capacity, were not ſo convenient as Rivers, where many Miniſters at once might be doing the work, whereas at a Font hardly any more baptized than one at once. But, be that as it will, doth this prove, that none either in <hi>England,</hi> or in any other country, either in thoſe, or any other Ages, were baptized by ſprinkling, or any other way than by a total dipping? It is impoſſible it ſhould, eſpecially when the contrary to it is evidenced by Fact, as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107492:124"/> I have made appear in theſe Papers, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. This then only follows hence, that this whole paſſage is a grand imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and proves nothing of what is diſputed of in this queſtion: which is not, whether any, or what number, were baptized by dipping; but whether never any in the Church were baptized by Sprinkling, or other way than by a total immerſion.</p>
               <p n="29">§. 29. Having written thus much on ſuppoſition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in the quotation, I reſolved to conſult the Author himſelf. And though not according to the quotation made by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 138, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in <hi>pag.</hi> 107. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 70, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I found this which follows. But to return to <hi>Auſtin</hi> again, who by report of Authors was departed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this cruelty was done, after he had baptized and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened ten thouſand <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Angles</hi> in the Weſt river, that is called <hi>Swale,</hi> beſide <hi>York,</hi> on Chriſtmaſs-day, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his end to draw near, he ordained a Succeſſor named <hi>Laurentius,</hi> to rule after him the Archbiſhops See of <hi>Dorobernia.</hi> Where note by the way (Chriſtian Reader) that whereas <hi>Auſtin</hi> baptized then in Rivers; it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there was then no uſe of Fonts. Again if it be true that <hi>Fabian</hi> ſaith, he baptized Ten thouſand in one day: the rite then of baptizing at <hi>Rome</hi> was not ſo Ceremonial, neither had ſo many Trinkets at that time, as it hath ſince: or elſe it could not be that he could baptize ſo many on one day.</p>
               <p>Upon this Relation I ſhall crave the Readers leave to make ſome remarks.</p>
               <p n="30">§. 30. And firſt, ſuppoſing <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to have been a man of great ſtrength, and then at the fulneſs of it, yet the number of the Perſons ſaid to be baptized by him, and all in one day, (<hi>viz.</hi> 10000.) is ſo great, as that it exceeds all meaſures of credibility, that ſo many could be baptized of him by a total dipping of them. When we read of but <hi>Three thouſand</hi> baptized in one day by twelve perſons, wiſe and learned men think it reaſonable, from the difficulty, if not impoſſibility of it, that ſo many ſhould by a total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107492:124"/> be baptized by ſo few in ſo ſhort a time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there baptizing was performed, not by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, but by ſprinkling. Now much more ſtrongly is the ſame to be argued, when againſt three thouſand to twelve, is ſet Ten thouſand to one.</p>
               <p n="31">§. 31. But then Secondly, if we conſider the time of his Life, when this was done, the improbability, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſibility of it will ſtill the more appear. It was when his ſtrength was gone, when he was an old man, and near his death. For the very next thing, that our Author mentions of him, after his performance of this great bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is his perceiving his end to draw near. Had he had the ſtrength of <hi>Samſon,</hi> ſuch a days work as the total dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Ten thouſand men had been enough to have tired him to the death. How much more unable was an old man with one foot in his grave to go through ſuch a ſervice! And if it be argued from the inability of all the Miniſters of a whole City to baptize by dipping, but ſo many as came to be baptized at the mother Church, only on one of the three ſolemn times of the year, that (becauſe the greatneſs of the work of lifting of ſo many into and out of the Fonts exceeded the ſtrength of the Baptizers) therefore they baptized by Sprinkling: how much more may it be argued from the inſufficiency of one old, and conſequently a weak man, for the total immerſion of ſo many as Ten thouſand at once, that he did it not by dipping, but by ſprinkling?</p>
               <p n="32">§. 32. And yet Thirdly, if we conſider the time of the year, when this is ſaid to be done, it will ſtill render it more improbable, or rather impoſſible. It was on no other than <hi>Chriſtmaſs-day,</hi> anciently called <hi>Midwinter-day.</hi> It cannot, I think, be well imagined how one man ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally dip another in a River, who is not himſelf in the ſame River with him. Nor is any thing ſuggeſted to the contrary in all the Antiquities I have converſed with, ſo far as I can call to remembrance. So then <hi>Auguſtin</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed in that ſtarving Seaſon to ſtand in the ſame River all the while that he was baptizing them. Now that an Old
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107492:125"/> man ſhould be able to ſtand either naked, or clothed in a River, and on a <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> and till he had totally dipped Ten thouſand men, is ſo far beyond all degrees of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that it can be concluded nothing leſs than impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="33">§ 33. Either then there was no ſuch baptizing of ſuch a multitude in a River (at that time eſpecially) and then, why did Mr. <hi>D.</hi> urge that practice of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> upon us? or elſe it was done in a way that was more practicable: and then nothing can put in ſo fair a plea for it as ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Nay, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf argues, that either there was leſs to do about Baptiſm in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, than in his own (his words are, that the Rite of it was not ſo Ceremonial, neither had ſo many Trinkets at that time, as it hath ſince,) or elſe it could not be, that he could baptize ſo many in one day.</p>
               <p n="34">§. 34. Now why Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would only tell us in general of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> baptizing great multitudes in Rivers, and not tell us of theſe particularities of his baptizing them, it is eaſie to conjecture; even becauſe he ſaw he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, but that preſently theſe, or ſome ſuch like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks would be made upon them, and ſo his quotation would either prove to be to no purpoſe, or elſe to be againſt his own purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="35">§. 35. And as for the ſtorie of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> which is a different thing from that of <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> however jumbled together into one by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> it is plainly this, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Mr. <hi>Fox, pag.</hi> 109. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>lin.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that having firſt baptized King <hi>Edwine</hi> with many other of his ſubjects with him at <hi>York,</hi> he did from that time forth, during the life of <hi>Edwine,</hi> which was the term of ſix years more, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Chriſten in the Rivers of <hi>Gwenie,</hi> and <hi>Swala,</hi> in both Provinces of <hi>Deira,</hi> and in <hi>Berenicia,</hi> uſing the ſaid Rivers for Fonts.</p>
               <p n="36">§. 36. But firſt, it is not here ſaid, that he dipped them in thoſe Rivers. And if it had been ſo ſaid, it had only proved poſitively that dipping was thenin uſe, not negatively, that ſprinkling was not. Secondly that Note, which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:107492:125"/> makes concerning <hi>Auguſtines</hi> baptizing in Rivers, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was becauſe there was then no uſe of Fonts, is not added alſo upon <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s baptizing in Rivers, though Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> ſets it after both, as belonging to both. Thirdly, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-dipping was not the only way of baptizing uſed by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus.</hi> For neither King <hi>Edwine</hi> himſelf, nor thoſe many ſubjects of his, that were baptized with him, were, by the Confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> baptized in any River. For he tells us in his Margin to that place, where he relates the ſtory, that King <hi>Edwine</hi> was baptized in St. <hi>Peters-Church</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> which he cauſed firſt to be made of Wood (and that in order to his being baptized therein, as <hi>Bede</hi> informs us) which was after by St. <hi>Oſwald</hi> builded of Stone.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bed.</hi> Eccl. Hiſt. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> And if that bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing was in the Church, then it could not be in the River, eſpecially as the Church now ſtands, unleſs afterward weary of ſtanding ſo low it took its progreſs and walked up the hill. And if it were in a Church, that the baptiſm was, then whether it were not in a Font; and whether not by ſprinkling, or at moſt a partial merſation, ſince we have no remains, that I know, of any Fonts of capacity for a total immerſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of Infants, it is free for the Reader to make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. And he that five hundred years hence ſhould read the ſtory of the baptiſm of the Turk converted by Dr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and ſhould ſee in the Churches then, no other Fonts, but ſuch as we have in our Churches now, would never imagine that Baptiſm to have been by <hi>dipping,</hi> but would conclude, that it was by aſperſion, or affuſion, or at moſt by a partial merſation.</p>
               <p n="37">§. 37. As to what he ſaith concerning <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> the two French Evangeliſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did in the Fifth Century baptize multitudes in the River <hi>Allin</hi> near <hi>Cheſter,</hi> which we ſhall find hereafter, I anſwer, firſt, that having neither told us where, nor when we ſhould find it, we might well paſs it over without further notice, till we ſhould meet with it. But ſecondly, having a deſire to know
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107492:126"/> further, what might be diſcovered of them, that concerned our preſent purpoſe, and not having time to read over all that remained behind in his book for it, I conſulted his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex: but it ſhould ſeem, what was ſaid of them, was not worthy ſo great a remark as to be put in there. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, out of a deſire to be ſatisfied, turning over the leaves of his book, I found in <hi>pag.</hi> 228. that thoſe two famous French men being ſent over into <hi>Britain,</hi> to help againſt the <hi>Pelagian hereſie,</hi> were inſtrumental to convert many, and did baptize great multitudes upon confeſſion of Faith in the River <hi>Allin</hi> near <hi>Cheſter.</hi> But ſtill we are but where we were before. For 'tis only ſaid here, that thoſe two Evangeliſts did baptize many in the River <hi>Allin:</hi> and 'tis but the ſame man, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> that ſaith it. But how they baptized there, whether by aſperſion, affuſion, partial merſation, or total immerſion, is not ſaid, no not by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> himſelf. Yet thirdly, I examined ſeveral Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and Hiſtorians about it, <hi>viz. Fox,</hi> and <hi>Holinſhead, Marian. Scotus; Sigebert Gemblac. Faſcic. Temp. Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. Cent. Vincent. Belluacenſ. Spondan. Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Bedes Hiſtory:</hi> but not a word in them all appears, by which their total dipping in that River is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Fourthly, then it muſt be concluded, that becauſe it was in a River, that they were baptized, therefore at their baptiſm they were dipped. But that, as we have already ſhewed, is a weak inference; and grounded on no certain bottom. And if River-baptizing infer total immerſing, then by the ſame conſequence, or as good, Baptiſm out of a River infers Sprinkling, or ſome other way diſtinct from total dipping. And if that be good, then from <hi>Bede</hi>'s relation of the baptizing of a great multitude in a <hi>Church</hi> erected for that purpoſe, ſo far as I can gather from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that Hiſtory,<note place="margin">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107492:126"/> the ſaid <hi>Germanus</hi> did baptize a great multitude otherwiſe, than by dipping. And ſo his baptizing in <hi>Allin,</hi> though we ſuppoſe it to have been done there by dipping, is no prejudice to our cauſe. Let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> give us the one, or not ask of us the other. Though in truth neither way of arguing is demonſtrative, what probability ſoever may be ſuppoſed to be in either. But —</p>

               <p n="40">§. 40. Whom does he mean by the <hi>Veteres,</hi> the Ancients here? The Predeceſſors of Chriſtianity in any one Age, or more? And does he ſpeak of them univerſally, ſo as to mean, that in any one, or more of the firſt Ages, no one was baptized by ſprinkling, but all, without exception, by dipping, and that thrice? It will be long before his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archſhip will be able to prove either the Affirmative or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part of his Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="41">§. 41. Firſt, to prove an Immerſion (meaning a total one) in the firſt Age is not very eaſie, much leſs a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold one, by any witneſs that lived in that Age. By the Scripture I am ſure he cannot. For that ſpeaks indeed of baptizing into the name of <hi>three perſons,</hi> but not of <hi>three dippings</hi> at the three namings of thoſe Perſons: though I rationally believe it to have been ſo in the firſt Age, becauſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107492:127"/> I find it to have been ſo in the ſecond, and yet find no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it there.</p>
               <p n="42">§. 42. And ſecondly, to prove, that none were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſprinkling, is more hard. For finding ſprinkling in the after Ages, and finding no riſe of it, when firſt it began, in any one of them, it is as ſuppoſable, that it alſo came from the firſt, as that the trine Immerſion did. Which, as I noted, none of the firſt Age more ſpeak to, than they do of ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="43">§. 43. But the Patriarch gives us their ground of that practice, the words of the Goſpel, <hi>Aſcendit ex aquâ,</hi> and thence he ſuppoſed, that they gathered, <hi>ergo deſcenderat,</hi> therefore he went down into it. And thereupon infers his Concluſion with an <hi>Ecce</hi> of Triumph, <hi>Ecce immerſio, non aſperſio,</hi> Behold an immerſion, not an aſperſion.</p>
               <p n="44">§. 44. But I think thoſe Ancients lived nearer <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time than he, and were better Logicians than to infer ſuch a concluſion from ſuch premiſſes. For firſt, the word in the original is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, he aſcended, not out of, but from the water; now that he might do, that was not at all in it, but only by it, at the brink, or bank of it. <hi>A going down to</hi> the water they might gather, but not <hi>a going down into</hi> the water. And ſecondly, unleſs it had been impoſſible for any man to go into the water, without going ſo into it, as to be covered all over with it, neither his going into it, nor his coming out of it, can ever prove his total immerſion in it. If from any Topic elſe it may be inferred, well, and good: but from this it can never be: as I have ſhewn in theſe Papers, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. where this matter is particularly, and at large debated on. So that there is no need to ſeek for ſhelter in the Patriarchs only ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering from hence an Immerſion, and not expreſſing that Immerſion to be a total one: leſs than which nothing will ſerve our Total Dippers: and therefore I ſhall paſs on, and receive the charge of his next Author.</p>

               <p n="46">§. 46. I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> had this quotation from Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> in whom it is, but was loth any body ſhould look for it there, for fear of what follows from <hi>Danaeus,</hi> by whom we are told that (and told the reaſon too why) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is commonly in Scripture taken <hi>pro lotione &amp; mundatione,</hi> for waſhing and cleanſing.</p>
               <p n="47">§. 47. But be that as it will, the Teſtimony will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us much to anſwer it. For if the Author meant, that <hi>of old</hi> it was <hi>a cuſtom</hi> to adminiſter Baptiſm by dipping, or <hi>the more uſual,</hi> or <hi>more general cuſtom</hi> ſo to adminiſter it, we ſhall eaſily grant it. But if he meant, that it was the <hi>only</hi> cuſtom of old ſo to adminiſter it, I have given ſo ſufficient evidence of other cuſtoms beſides that, even of old, that we muſt, and with good reaſon enter our diſſent from him.</p>
               <p n="48">§. 48. And whereas the Quoter ſaith, it was <hi>of old</hi> the Cuſtom, the Authors word is <hi>initio,</hi> at firſt or in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Now it is to be ſuſpected by his rendring that word <hi>of old,</hi> that he deſigned to put a ſlur upon us, as if that Author had intended to declare or intimate, that ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was no cuſtom of old, but a new practice come up but of late into the Church: whereas it pleads Antiquity for it ſelf, and that ſo high, that none can find any origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of it lower than the Primitive times. And ſo, though it might not have been a cuſtom <hi>initio,</hi> at the very firſt, to baptize that way, but dipping may claim the priority of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107492:128"/> it for that, yet it might very ſoon after the firſt beginning upon reaſons thought well of by the Apoſtles, or Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical perſons, come into practice, and ſo become a cuſtom of old, though it were not a cuſtom <hi>initio,</hi> in, or at the firſt beginning. <hi>Deacons,</hi> as diſtinct Officers from Apoſtles, were of old, in the Primitive times, even in the Apoſtles days: and yet they were not <hi>initio,</hi> at the firſt beginning of Chriſtianity, or conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church, but ordained ſome time after its beginning, and by the Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="49">§. 49. And whereas that Author ſaith, that we now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>pro</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e. Rhantiſm</hi> inſtead of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> I anſwer, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is taken two ways: firſt, more <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> for the <hi>act</hi> of immerſion or dipping, or more <hi>largely,</hi> for the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Baptiſm however adminiſtred. And ſo, though inſtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> dipping, we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſprinkling; yet we have not that ſprinkling inſtead of baptiſm, as if our ſprinkling were no baptizing, but ſomewhat elſe inſtead of it: but we have it for what it really is, a true baptiſm in the larger ſenſe, though it be not a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſtrict ſenſe of that word as it ſignifies dipping; though ſprinkling be not ſtrictly dipping, yet it is truly baptizing.</p>
               <p n="50">§. 50. From <hi>Zepperus</hi> he is in haſte to go to Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> (a Champion he often glories in,) and ſaith he, <q>Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> in his <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conſcience, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 644, 645. The Ancient Church did not in their Baptiſm ſprinkle Water with their hands, but did immerge; and therefore we find in the Records of the Church, that the Perſons to be baptized were quite naked, as it is to be ſeen in many places, particularly in the <hi>Myſtagogy Chat.</hi> (as he writes it) of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and many others (as you have before in the ſecond Chapter of this Part, from <hi>Voſſius, p.</hi> 133.)</q> And I ſhall follow him as faſt to attend the motions of that Doctor. And I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="51">§. 51. Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> did, as I, and all good men, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, would do, <hi>i. e.</hi> wiſh'd as near a conformity in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107492:128"/> preſent Church to the Primitive, as the Circumſtances of both may well permit: and therefore repreſents things tending that way as favourable as he could: but his words muſt not be tenter-hook'd, and ſtretch't to a meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his mind. And whether they be not ſo here, will be left to the Readers judgment. In this very Section and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph he tells you, that of this Sprinkling, beſides what is implyed in the former Teſtimonies, there was <hi>ſome little uſe</hi> in the Primitive Church. And he backs this ſaying of his with proofs from <hi>Tertullian, Surius,</hi> and <hi>Walafrid Strabo.</hi> When therefore he ſaith, that the Ancient Churches did not in their Baptiſms ſprinkle water with their hands, but immerged the Catechumen, or the <hi>Infant</hi> (for thoſe are his words, which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> diſguiſes, and curtails, and ſhrinks up into a barely, <hi>but did immerge,</hi> for ends beſt known to himſelf, but eaſily gueſſable at by any man, though of no greater abilities than I am) I ſay, in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his words cannot in reaſon be taken, as if he meant, that abſolutely and univerſally all without exception were then immerged, and none were ſprinkled: for that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to what himſelf afterward in the ſame Paragraph ſaith and proveth, as I have already noted: but that moſtly and generally it was ſo: the contrary practice being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent (as not uſed in ordinary caſes, but only ſuch as were of high charity and great neceſſity) that it was little taken notice of in publick. So that ſpeaking according to what was <hi>generally</hi> done, and <hi>publickly</hi> obſerved, he might infer from the Authorities by him inſiſted on, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Ancient Churches was not ſprinkling, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion. But though it may be granted, that the cuſtom was not ſprinkling, but dipping, yet it will not follow thence, that there was never any thing of that nature done in thoſe times <hi>contrary to the cuſtom:</hi> for the contrary is apparent. And therefore D. <hi>Cave</hi> in his Teſtimony cited by Mr. <hi>D. p.</hi> 200. ſpeaks warily and ſafely in the caſe, ſaying, not abſolutely, that it was the conſtant and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal cuſtom of thoſe times, but <hi>the almoſt</hi> conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107492:129"/> cuſtom. And ſo B. <hi>Taylor</hi> is to be underſtood, if we will make him conſiſtent with himſelf: as we muſt do, or elſe his Teſtimony will be nothing worth on either ſide, and he will be no more againſt us, than for us: and his quoting will ſignifie nothing more, but that the Quoter had a mind to make a noiſe with <hi>his Name,</hi> and object him to us, as being an eminent, not only member of, but Miniſter in our Church, and a Biſhop in that Church wherein he lived, when he publiſhed that Writing, at leaſt the ſecond time. I wonder the Quoter did not take notice of this concluſive paſſage of his, and eſpecially of what follows immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added to the words recited by me, <hi>viz.</hi> That that cuſtom of the Ancient Churches was in purſuance of the ſenſe of the word in the Commandment, and the example of our Bleſſed Saviour. Which if he had, I have given anſwer thereto in theſe Papers, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. and 16. I ſhall only make this remark upon it in favour of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> That he is the more pardonable, if he ſometimes takes no notice of what is againſt him, when he can paſs by ſome, and ſuch notices, that ſeem to be for him. But if there be wilfulneſs on the one ſide, and but inadvertency on the other ſide, I ſhall then plead nothing for him, but leave him there to plead for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="52">§. 52. But Mr. <hi>D.</hi> goes on (and I ſhall follow him) <q>And this Immerſion (ſaith he from Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>) was of ſo Sacred an account in their eſteem, that they did not account it lawful to receive him into the Clergy, who had been only Sprinkled in his Baptiſm, as we learn from the Epiſtle of <hi>Cornelius</hi> to <hi>Fabianus</hi> of <hi>Antioch, Euſeb. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 43. It is not lawful that he who is ſprinkled in his Bed by reaſon of ſickneſs ſhould be admitted into Holy Orders, doubting whether ſuch a Sprinkling ſhould be called Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="53">§. 53. I wonder Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould produce this inſtance: becauſe it is an unanſwerable proof of a baptizing by way of Sprinkling ſo early in the Church as the time of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> of whom the ſtory is: and who no doubt, was not
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107492:129"/> the firſt man, that was ſo baptized: becauſe his being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſo was pleaded in Bar againſt his admiſſion into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as being againſt <hi>Law:</hi> and ſo this inſtance is a clear evidence of ſuch a practice even before his time, which falling to be about <hi>anno</hi> 250. it may well be preſumed, that ſuch baptizing was at leaſt in the Century before, that is the ſecond, if it were not alſo in the firſt (as who can ſay it was not?) Laws not being in that perſecutious time of the Church ſo eaſie, and ſuddainly made for the Catholick Church: eſpecially if it were unlawful by any <hi>Canon;</hi> (as I ſee none made for it before that time, though it came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward into the Codex of Canons, being ſo eſtabliſhed after in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi>) and much leſs if by cuſtom: for that requires long time, and many inſtances, and much obſervation to be brought up by. And as to the Baptiſm it ſelf, I apprehend it was not the unſufficiency of that, which made it unlawful for the ſo baptized to be admitted into Holy Orders, but other Reaſon, which I have given in theſe Papers, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. And as for <hi>Novatus</hi>'s Baptiſm, it is by <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſufficiently owned to be a Baptiſm, whilſt he accuſes him for his forſaking of the Church of God, wherein he was baptized, as I have ſhewed there alſo. Which could not have been ſaid with ſenſe, if he had not at all been baptized; or if the baptiſm, which he had received, had been a nullity.</p>
               <p n="54">§. 54. As for thoſe words added to what went before, as if they had been Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> words <hi>[doubting whether ſuch a ſprinkling ſhould be called a baptiſm]</hi> I cannot be juſt to the truth, unleſs I ſay, they are not Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> words, but an Addition of Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s. as any that will conſult the place may ſee. Yet ſomething there is, that is near to, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſame with, this paſſage: for it follows in the Doctor, Nay it went further than this, they were not ſure, that they were rightly Chriſtned, yea or no, who were only ſprinkled; as appears in the ſame Epiſtle of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which <hi>Nicephorus</hi> thus renders <hi>[if at leaſt ſuch a ſprinkling may
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107492:130"/> be called a Baptiſm.]</hi> Yet this is but near to, not the ſame. For it is one thing, not to be done at all; and another thing not to be done rightly: and many things are not done rightly, which yet when done, are held valid and good: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vulgar ſaying in this caſe, <hi>Fieri non debu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, factum valuit.</hi> That which they were not ſure of was, not whether ſuch a Sprinkling ſhould be called a Baptiſm; but whether thoſe that were only ſprinkled, were rightly baptized: I ſay, not whether they were baptized at all, but whether they were baptized rightly, which is clear another thing from what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would infer. And as for the Reaſon of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his words of doubt, I have ſpoken to that in <hi>ch.</hi> 10. and ſhewed it to be another thing. And if <hi>Nicephorus</hi> miſunderſtood him, who is to blame for that? There is a great deal of difference between thoſe words <hi>[if one ought to ſay, that ſuch a man did receive baptiſm]</hi> and theſe <hi>[if at leaſt ſuch a ſprinkling may be called baptiſm.]</hi> For a total dipping into water by a due Miniſter, with a right form of words, is even in the Anabaptiſts Dictionary a baptiſm: and it cannot be ſaid, but that ſuch an immerſion is a baptiſm. And yet of an Infant ſo baptized, an Anabaptiſt would ſay, <hi>[if one ought to ſay, that ſuch a one did receive baptiſm]</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would deny that he did receive it. But I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Nicephorus</hi> underſtood well enough what he ſaid, and that his Tranſlators did not underſtand him (I would be loth to ſay were willing to miſtake him.) For what ſaith he? If <hi>at leaſt ſuch a ſprinkling may be called a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> He doth not ſay abſolutely, if a Sprinkling, or any ſprinkling, may be called a baptiſm: no, that was not the doubt with him: but if <hi>ſuch a ſprinkling,</hi> [that is, a <hi>ſprinkling given to ſuch a perſon,</hi> and in <hi>ſuch a condition,</hi> at <hi>ſuch a time,</hi> and not <hi>conſummated</hi> by that, which was by the then Canon, or cuſtom to have followed, as I have ſhewed <hi>ch.</hi> 10] may be called a baptiſm, which is no more than to ſay, if ſuch a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, [be the manner of it, what it will] may be called a baptiſm. Which makes nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="55">
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:107492:130"/>§. 55. But to go on with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> 
                  <q>And therefore (ſaith he as from Dr. <hi>Taylor) Magnus</hi> in his Epiſtle, queſtions whether they are to be eſteemed right Chriſtians, who are only ſprinkled, and not dipped in water.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="56">§. 56. Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> words (which it had been more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, as I conceive, in producing his Teſtimony, to ſet down, as he ſpake them) are theſe. And this was not only ſpoken in diminution of <hi>Novatus,</hi> and indignation againſt his perſon: for it was a formal queſtion made by <hi>Magnus</hi> to St. <hi>Cyprian, an habendi ſint Chriſtiani legitimi, cò quòd aquâ ſalutari non loti ſunt, ſed perfuſi.</hi> Whether they are to be eſteemed right Chriſtians, who were only ſprinkled with water, and not waſhed or dipped.</p>
               <p n="57">§. 57. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſure was loth to hear baptiſm called by any other name, but what neceſſarily implies dipping; and therefore he left <hi>waſhed</hi> out: and yet <hi>waſhed,</hi> not <hi>dipped</hi> is St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> word: and perhaps his meaning too. For within a few lines he ſaith, The breaſt of the Believer is <hi>waſhed</hi> one way,<note place="margin">Neque enim ſic in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramento ſalutari deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum contagia, ut in lavacro carnali &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culari ſordes cutis &amp; corporis abluuntur, ut &amp; ſapone &amp; nitris &amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris quoque adjumentis, &amp; dolio, &amp; piſcinâ opus ſit, quibus ablul &amp; mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari corpuſculum poſſit. Aliter pectus credentis abluitur, aliter mens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis per fidei merita mundatur, <hi>Cypr.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi> ep. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> the mind of man through the merits of Faith is cleanſed another way. So that he ſeems not at all to ſpeak of <hi>dipping,</hi> but of <hi>waſhing,</hi> and that of the <hi>breaſt</hi> only. And what if one <hi>Magnus</hi> (more ſcrupulous it ſeems than others) did make ſuch a formal and ſolemn queſtion? It follows not that all elſe, or any other beſides him were unſatisfied about it. And it is apparent that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf was well ſatisfied in the caſe. For he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> tells us, though Mr. <hi>D.</hi> does not,<note place="margin">In Sacramentis ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taribus neceſſitate cogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; deo indulgentiam ſuam largiente, totum credentibus conferunt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina compendia.

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107492:131"/> pardoning, and neceſſity compelling, or rather, as I think it ought to be rendred, neceſſity compelling, and God permitting.</p>
               <p n="58">§. 58. And this (he goes on) is the ſenſe and Law of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> not that it be indifferent, but that all Infants be dipped, except in the caſe of ſickneſs, and then ſprinkling is permitted. And ſo it was in thoſe times when the Doctor firſt wrote this. But the ſenſe and Law of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſince that grown ſtill a little more favourable. For in the Office of <hi>Publick Baptiſm</hi> of Infants the dipping of the Infant is appointed with an <hi>If [if they ſhall certifie that the Child may well endure it.]</hi> So then no ſuch certification being made, the Miniſter is not appointed to dip it; nor is he required to <hi>ask,</hi> whether the Child may well endure it or no: and ſeeing them offer the Child to Baptiſm in ſuch a condition as it is unfit to dip it in, he may in reaſon preſume, without their certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either way, that it may not endure it. Their very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it in that condition is an Interpretative Certification of its inability to ſuffer baptization by a total immerſion. And being that in the Office of <hi>Baptiſm of perſons of riper years,</hi> dipping in the water, or pouring water on, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently preſcribed, and clearly left to the Miniſter's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, without <hi>ifs</hi> or <hi>ands,</hi> where yet the Perſon is of age and ſtrength enough to endure it: he may rationally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he is at the ſame liberty with Infants, of whoſe ſtrength, in regard of their age, there is no ground for ſuch preſumption.</p>
               <p n="59">§. 59. After this the Doctor goes on to confirm the uſe of ſprinkling from inſtance of ſome, though little uſe of it in the Primitive Church, which he ſhews from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Acts of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Surius;</hi> and <hi>Walafrid Strabo:</hi> and for further confirmation adds the Opinion of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that the Three Thouſand, and Five Thouſand Converts in the <hi>Acts,</hi> were ſo baptized. All which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is pleaſed to over-paſs.</p>
               <p n="60">§. 60. But then having weakened this laſt proof from
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107492:131"/> 
                  <hi>Aquinas,</hi> by calling it but a <hi>conjecture,</hi> and ſaying it hath <hi>no tradition,</hi> nor <hi>record</hi> to warrant it, he draws towards the concluſion of that, which all this diſcourſe about dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſprinkling is brought to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in the adminiſtration of a Sacrament introduc'd againſt the Analogy and myſtery, the purpoſe and ſignification of it, is not to be complied with, ſaying, And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in caſes of need and charity the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not want <hi>ſome good Examples</hi> in the beſt times to countenance that permiſſion, yet we are to follow her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe that command is not only according to the meaning and intent of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but agrees with the myſtery of the Sacrament it ſelf; <hi>For we are buried with him in baptiſm,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; adding thereto this teſtimony from St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tranſcribes from him, <hi>In aquâ tanquam in ſepulchro caput immergentibus vetus homo ſepelitur, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergitur, deinde nobis emergentibus novus reſurgit inde.</hi> 
                  <q>The old Man is buried and drowned in the <hi>immerſion under water,</hi> and when the baptized Perſon is lifted up from the water, it repreſents the Reſurrection of the new Man to newneſs of life.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="61">§. 61. In which part of the diſcourſe I cannot but note three things, which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> was not pleaſed to advert unto. Firſt, an acknowledgment, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not want ſome <hi>good examples</hi> in the <hi>best times</hi> to countenance her permiſſion of ſprinkling. <hi>Good Examples,</hi> and in the <hi>Best Times,</hi> are very material words for us, and give us an Antiquity as old, and as good, as we can deſire, and utterly overthrow all that ever can be ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, eſpecially on the account of Antiquity. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Analogy betwixt Immerſion and Emerſion, and the Death or Burial of the old Man, and Reſurrection of the new Man, is made the myſtery of the Sacrament, and by the manner of ſpeech ſo made the myſtery, as if it were the only myſtery of it: our waſhing from ſin by the blood of Chriſt, which is the prime ſignification and myſtery
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:107492:132"/> of the Sacrament, being paſſed by, on no account, that I know of, unleſs, becauſe if that were either the whole, or any part of the myſtery of the Sacrament, that would hold analogy with ſprinkling, and ſo weaken the Inference for Dipping. Thirdly, that whereas the Immerſion St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of, is, as far as his words will bear, but an immerſion or dipping of the <hi>head [caput immergentibus,</hi> is his word] both the Doctor and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſlip that by, without the leaſt notice of it, and hide it under a general ambiguous term of <hi>immerſion under the water,</hi> which is apt to carry away the mind to think of a total immerſion of the <hi>whole man,</hi> whileſt it is but the <hi>head,</hi> whoſe immerging the Father ſpeaks of. At this rate who may not be made to ſay even what one wills?</p>
               <p n="62">§. 62. At length both the Doctor and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> come to a Concluſion. <q>And therefore (ſaith Mr. <hi>D.</hi>) he concludes, That the contrary cuſtom being not only againſt Eccleſiaſtical Law, but againſt the Analogy, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſignification of the Sacrament, is not to be complied with.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="63">§. 63. But why did Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſtop there? and not do the Doctor and the truth right, in adding the Exception fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing? Unleſs in ſuch caſes that be of themſelves ſufficient to juſtifie a liberty in a Ritual and Ceremony; that is, a caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="64">§. 64. To Mr. <hi>D.</hi> I ſhall anſwer firſt, That, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the allowance of any ſuch caſe or caſes, were not conſiſtent with his Hypotheſis; and that the adding of thoſe words would have made the Doctor's teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to his turn, and therefore he thought fit to leave them out. With how great ingenuity I leave to his own judgment.</p>
               <p n="65">§. 65. Then to the Doctor I ſay firſt, that the Cuſtom of ſprinkling is not now againſt our Eccleſiaſtical Law, which hath preſcribed dipping, or pouring on of water indifferently in the caſe of the publick baptiſm of <hi>perſons of riper age;</hi> and hath appointed pouring on of water in the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107492:132"/> caſe of the <hi>ſick Infant</hi> baptized privately; and hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed dipping, nor ſprinkling in the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants brought to Publick Baptiſm, but accordingly as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their ability, or inability to endure dipping, ſhall be made. And then as to the Analogy and myſterious ſignification of the Sacrament, that ſprinkling or pouring on of water is not againſt that, but very agreeable with it, I have ſhewn at large in the Ninth Chapter of this Book, and ſhall further ſhew in the Sixteenth; whither I refer the Reader for his ſatisfaction. And in the mean time I think I may conclude that the advantage which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his cauſe by this great Man's teſtimony ſignifies as much as comes to nothing.</p>
               <p n="66">§. 66. I wonder Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſlipt what the Doctor ſaith in the cloſe of his 15th. <hi>Paragr. p.</hi> 646. <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe it is better to uſe dipping, and it is more agreeable to the myſtery to uſe it three times, and that ſo the Ancient Church underſtood it, therefore theſe things are a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant to acquit us from the obligation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cuſtom; becauſe a cuſtom againſt which there is ſo much probability, and in which there is no neceſſity and no advantage, is to be preſumed unreaſonable. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if I may preſume to gueſs, was partly becauſe he ſaw the Doctor's diſpute lay not againſt the <hi>unlawfulneſs,</hi> but <hi>obligatorineſs</hi> of the contrary cuſtom. And he might ſee, that as the probability againſt it was not ſo great, as the Doctor fancied, ſo the neceſſity of it was ſometimes ſo much, and the advantages in caſes of neceſſity and charity ſo conſiderable, as that it could not be preſumed unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but on the contrary ought to be judged very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Partly it was becauſe the Doctor doth in the very next words in the former clauſe of the ſame period aſſert, that <hi>becauſe there is even in sprinkling ſomething of the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the myſtery, as is rightly obſerved by Aquinas, and Dominicus à Soto; and becauſe it is not certain, that the beſt repreſentation, and the moſt expreſſive ceremony, is required; therefore the Church, upon great cauſe, may lawfully do either.</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:107492:133"/> Which he was unwilling any of his Party ſhould know. And thus much for Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="67">§. 67. From this Champion of our own Church, we are next called to receive a charge from a brisk Champion of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> words it. <q>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſaith he) confeſſeth by a <hi>Learned Pen,</hi> the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Worceſter</hi> in his <hi>Certam. Relig.</hi> That ſhe changed dipping the Party baptized over Head and Ears, into ſprinkling upon the Face.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="68">§. 68. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſhould rather have ſaid, as I think, a Learned Pen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confeſſeth. For not the writing of every Learned Man is preſently the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church he is of: for when ſo Learned Men of the ſame Church are of contrary judgments, and write contrary things, then the Church they are of muſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo too: and that is to ſpeak her a Church of no judgment. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not endure that. Nor would Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Church (I believe) be willing to eſpouſe all his aſſertions as her Confeſſions. But that is to be taken for the Confeſſion of a Church, which is profeſſed by her in her publick Writings, compiled by Perſons authorized thereunto, confirmed by the Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Miniſters, and made authentick by the atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Supreme Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p n="69">§. 69. But what is it that the <hi>Marquis</hi> ſaith ſhe did? That ſhe changed dipping into ſprinkling. This cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that before that change there was no ſprinkling at all in that Church: but that it wholly left off to dip, which had been the publick and ſolemn way of baptizing in that, as well as in other Churches; and in ſtead thereof, even in the publick and ſolemn baptizings, as well as in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate baptiſms, upon caſes of neceſſity, ſhe baptized by way of ſprinkling.</p>
               <p n="70">§. 70. And what was the change in this reſpect made? Dipping all the whole Body under the water into ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Face? The <hi>Marquis,</hi> even as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:107492:133"/> quotes him, ſaith not ſo: but dipping the Party baptized over Head and Ears. That may mean no more, but dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Head only all over (and by a Pleonaſm of ſpeech, his Ears too) under water, and not his whole Body. And that ſuch a way of baptizing has been in uſe in the Weſtern Church, I have ſhewed before, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. And if that were the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> meaning in what ſhe confeſſeth here by her <hi>Learned Pen,</hi> then Mr. <hi>D.</hi> gets nothing to his Cauſe by her Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>But if not, yet ſtill what change ſoever ſhe made therein, ſhe did no more than ſhe lawfully might, being inveſted with the ſame power in ſuch caſes, as other Churches have; and the thing it ſelf being no ſubſtantial part, but only an accidental circumſtance of that Sacrament: wherein Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have power to continue, or alter as they ſhall ſee beſt conducing to order, decency, and edification: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon grounds of neceſſity, charity, or great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.</p>
               <p n="71">§. 71. But I am of opinion, it was not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that made this Change: but a Church that had more power than that Church ever had, even the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> which <hi>Rome</hi> is not any more, than any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>National Church</hi> is; even ſo far as ſhe holds union, and fellowſhip with the Church <hi>Catholick</hi> in truth of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Eſſentials of Worſhip, and Subſtantials of Diſcipline. And this appears, becauſe the Church the <hi>Marquis</hi> there ſpeaks of, is that Church, that could depoſite the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> and introduce the obſervation of the <hi>Chriſtian Lord's Day;</hi> which ſure was not done by that particular Church, but by the whole Catholick Church throughout the World. And that Church indeed that could do that, could without doubt change the dipping over Head and Ears in Water, into a little ſprinkling upon the Face, by reaſon of ſome emergencies and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, occaſioned by the differences of Seaſons and Countries, (as the <hi>Marquis</hi> there adds) and may upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, accordingly diſpoſe of the manner of her adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107492:134"/> of her Sacraments. For ſure to depoſite the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a day expreſly commanded to be kept holy, and to introduce the like obſervation of another day, touching the keeping of which holy never any Command was given, (as none that we know of, was ever given for its ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though in all probability it was founded in <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Practice</hi> partly intimated in the Scriptures, and further notified by Tradition) implies a power as great as, if not greater than, to change a Rite in a Sacrament, not more commanded than the Sanctification of the Sabbath day, nor ſo much as that, if it were ever at all under any command, which is denyed by Learned men, as in thoſe Papers is ſhewn.</p>
               <p n="72">§. 72. So then, if there were no change made, then we are as we were at firſt. And if there were a change made, it was made by a Church, whether the Catholick or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had power to make it. Either way will ſerve our turn. For which way ſoever it be, our practice will be free from guilt: either as being it ſelf Primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick: or as being taken up into uſe inſtead of ſomewhat that then was uſed, by a Church that had power to make that change.</p>
               <p n="73">§. 73. Though after all, I ſhall not grant any change made herein, other than what I have already ſaid, from a practice but privately uſed in caſe of neceſſity, to become the general practice, even where Baptiſm is adminiſtred with greateſt ſolemnity.</p>
               <p n="74">§. 74. Having done with the <hi>Marquis,</hi> he goes on to tell us, <q>that, until the <hi>Third Century</hi> we find not any, that upon any conſideration, did admit of Sprinkling: and that the firſt we meet with is <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                  </q> To which having ſpoken before, I ſhall ſay nothing, but that, if in that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury it was admitted, it hath a fair antiquity to plead for it ſelf. But what probabilities there are of its having been practiſed before, I have already ſhewed, and therefore will not here repeat, but paſs on to his next Authors.</p>
               <p n="75">§. 75. <hi>Aquinas, Scotus,</hi> and others of the Schoolmen
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107492:134"/> conclude (as he tells us) <q>that Dipping is moſt agreeable to the Inſtitution, but admit, that in caſe of neceſſity, <hi>viz.</hi> when either many are to be baptized, ſcarcity of water, or ſickneſs, or weakneſs, they may Sprinkle. <hi>Voſſ. p.</hi> 38.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="76">§. 76. Suppoſe they do conclude Dipping to be moſt agreeable to the Inſtitution, yet things are well enough With us, ſince they do not conclude it only to be agreeable to it. And if they admit it in caſe of neceſſity, then in that caſe they hold it lawful. For in no caſe would they admit of that, which they judged unlawful. Becauſe evil is not to be done, that good may come thereof. But to come cloſer to him.</p>
               <p n="77">§. 77. In what part of <hi>Voſſius</hi> this is ſet down Mr. <hi>D.</hi> names not. But I gueſs it is in his firſt <hi>Diſput. de Baptiſmo, Theſſ.</hi> 9. and <hi>pag.</hi> 358. for which the Printer by miſtake put 38. Touching which, if that be the place, I obſerve firſt, that it is not <hi>Scotus,</hi> that is named there, but <hi>Sotus;</hi> not <hi>Jo. Scotus</hi> that was an oppoſer, but <hi>Dominicus Sotus,</hi> that was a follower of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> But this might be a miſtake of the Printers.</p>
               <p n="78">§. 78. Secondly, that <hi>no others</hi> of the Schoolmen are there named, but thoſe two, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Sotus.</hi> But it may be he put that in of his own head, beſides what he had in his Author. And yet if ſo, he ſhould not have vouched his Author for more than he named.</p>
               <p n="79">§. 79. Thirdly, that neither any School-men there named, nor <hi>Voſſius</hi> from them ſaith, That <hi>Dipping is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Inſtitution.</hi> Indeed <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>merſionem quidem magis congruam eſſe,</hi> that dipping is indeed more congruous; but he ſaith not to what. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſupplies it <hi>to the Inſtitution.</hi> I blame him not: it would make well for his cauſe, if it were ſo. But if we conſult <hi>Aquinas</hi> (in the place refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, as I ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Cùm in baptiſmo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumatur aqua ad corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ablutionem, non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò per immerſionem, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rùm etiam per aſperſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, vel effuſionem aquae baptiſmus dari poteſt: tutius tamen eſt (quia hoc habet communior uſus) per modum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſionis baptizare. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. 3.</hi> q. <hi>66.</hi> art. <hi>7.</hi> Concluſ.</note> by <hi>Voſſius</hi>) 3. <hi>q.</hi> 66. <hi>art.</hi> 7. <hi>conc.</hi> there is no mention of the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107492:135"/> which Dipping is either moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith) or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable than ſprinkling, but of the <hi>Common uſe</hi> of the Church: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of which he ſaith it is the <hi>ſafer</hi> to baptize by way of immerſion. A great deal of difference betwixt <hi>more ſafe in reſpect of common uſe,</hi> and <hi>moſt agreeable to the Inſtitution.</hi> So that neither theſe <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> nor the <hi>Quoter</hi> of them, afford Mr. <hi>D.</hi> any the leaſt patronage to his cauſe; which may juſtly be ſuſpected ſo much the worſe, in regard ſuch <hi>ſhifts</hi> are uſed for the maintaining of it.</p>
               <p n="80">§. 80. Fourthly, I will fairly relate, what theſe <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> ſay, and then leave the Reader to make his judgment on the caſe. The words of <hi>Dominicus Sotus,</hi> as <hi>Voſſius</hi> quotes them from <hi>diſt.</hi> 3. <hi>qu. un. art.</hi> 7. are theſe, <hi>In bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo aliquid eſt de eſſentiâ, ut ablutio, juxta illud ad Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>ubi Apoſtolus baptiſmum appellat lavacrum aquae; aliud verò accidentarium: nempe ut ablutio hoc vel illo modo fiat.</hi> In baptiſm ſomething is <hi>eſſential,</hi> as <hi>waſhing,</hi> according to that <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. where the Apoſtle calls baptiſm the <hi>waſhing of water:</hi> and ſomething is <hi>accidental,</hi> as that the <hi>waſhing</hi> be made <hi>this or that way.</hi> Now if ſo, then dipping is not of the Eſſence of Baptiſm, and ſo not neceſſarily to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed in baptizing. But herein (ſaith <hi>Voſſius</hi>) he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who alſo himſelf ſaith, that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is truly the more congruous (<hi>viz.</hi> to the common uſe, as I ſaid before:) and therefore thinks it ought not to be done otherwiſe unleſs for a reaſon that is either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or honeſt, or at leaſt agreeable unto reaſon. Yet notwithſtanding inaſmuch as water is taken in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſignifie the waſhing of the Soul by the waſhing of the body, and that waſhing may be made not only by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion, but alſo by effuſion, and aſperſion, he thinks truly that baptiſm may be adminiſtred after every one of theſe ways. And he adds four Cauſes for which it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107492:135"/> done than by dipping, which are (1.) great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of perſons to be baptized, (2.) Scarcity of water, as when there is not enough for dipping, (3.) Weakneſs of the Baptizer, unable to bear the perſon to be baptized, (4.) Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the perſon to whom the baptiſm is to be adminiſtred, by reaſon of which he would be endangered if dipped. And now, Reader, I leave you to make what eſtimate you pleaſe of theſe Authors, <hi>Aquinas, Sotus,</hi> and <hi>Voſſius,</hi> and of their Quoter, Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> And I leave him to triumph, as much as he pleaſeth, in the advantage he hath gotten by this, or any other the like Quotations.</p>
               <p n="81">§. 81. After the Schoolmen he proceeds to draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion by way of Recapitulation of Arguments from the <hi>Genuine ſence</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> Nature of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and Uſuage of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> which he ſaith were excellently inculcated by the Learned Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> in a Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Lecture in <hi>Michaels Cornhil</hi> London, <hi>April</hi> 15. 1673. from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <q>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death; proving from thence, that dipping or plunging was the proper Ceremony and Rite in that Ordinance; and how naturally Arguments did ariſe from that Sign in Baptiſm to enforce Holineſs and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the thing ſignified thereby.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="82">§. 82. That that Reverend Divine did preach a Sermon in that place, and at that time, and on that Text, I am apt to believe. But what he ſaid in it is not ſo eaſie to know. For not Mr. <hi>D.</hi> gives us his words. And after many inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Country, and at laſt ſending for it to <hi>London,</hi> I underſtand that Sermon was never yet Printed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>D.</hi> whom we have not found over candid in things that have been Printed, muſt excuſe us, if we be not over haſty to take his word in things that never yet came at the Preſs. As to the matter I eaſily believe that from the Rite of Dipping in Baptiſm there alluded unto by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the Doctor did rationally deduce and powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate Arguments to enforce to Holineſs and Mortification. But that the Doctor did prove, or had any ſuch deſign in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107492:136"/> that Sermon as to prove from that Text, that dipping or plunging was <hi>the proper</hi> Ceremony and Rite in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, meaning by <hi>the proper,</hi> the only lawful Rite, whence muſt follow, that there was therefore a neceſſity of Dipping in Baptiſm, I am not ſatisfied, nor ſhall be, till he tell us ſo himſelf. <hi>A proper</hi> Ceremony and Rite I ſhall eaſily grant he might affirm it to be: becauſe no body denies it. But that it was <hi>the proper</hi> Rite and Ceremony in the ſenſe newly expreſſed and explained, I am very confident he never ſaid, he never thought. Partly becauſe the Doctor is too learned not to know better things than ſo, Partly becauſe I ſuppoſe his own practice, as well as other mens, hath been to baptize after another manner. And partly becauſe I am aſſured from himſelf, that what he ſaid of the Apoſtles alluding in thoſe words <hi>[being buried with him in Baptiſm]</hi> to the ancient Rite or Manner of Baptizing,<note place="margin">Letter dated Jan. <hi>31. 1677.</hi>
                  </note> which was immerſion, was <q>without any mention, or ſo much as thought of any neceſſity thereby laid upon Chriſtians of obſerving punctually all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, uſed in the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, any more than of the other.</q> Which not the Anabaptiſts themſelves will ſay there is. And therefore the Reader may be ſatisfied, that, whatever Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſuggeſt to the contrary, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Perſon is no more conformable in judgment than in practice to the Anabaptiſts; nor is by any thing that he hath writ, or ſaid, a witneſs for them, and againſt the Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when by the allowance of the Church of <hi>England</hi> they baptize otherwiſe than by a total dipping, as in ſeveral caſes they do and may do it, by her allowance.</p>
               <p n="83">§. 83. And now, the field being thus far clear'd, I might fairly retreat. But becauſe I diſcern two ſtraglers behind and coming up at a diſtance, I will ſtand a while and receive their charge.</p>
               <p n="84">§. 84. The firſt is <hi>Ainſworth</hi> (who as we are told by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith) upon <hi>Lev.</hi> 15.5. <q>To baptize or waſh his
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107492:136"/> fleſh, as is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 13.16. meaning his whole body, and ſo the Greek Tranſlateth, ſhall waſh his body. The Hebrews ſay, every place where ought is ſaid in the Law of Bathing the fleſh, and waſhing the Cloaths of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, it is not meant, but of baptizing the whole body in water, <hi>Maim. in Makraoth, c.</hi> 1. <hi>ſ.</hi> 2. Figuring out our Sanctification by Chriſt, and his Spirit, by whom we <hi>draw near to God, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and bodies waſhed with pure water, Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>v.</hi> 11. If a man be baptized all over, ſaving the tip of his little finger, he is yet in his uncleanneſs.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="85">§. 85. The Greek Tranſlateth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>v.</hi> 13. ſhall <hi>waſh</hi> his body,<note place="margin">

I hope a thing may be waſhed, and waſhed all over, and yet not dipped. So their Tranſlation helpeth the cauſe nothing at all. And ſuppoſe the Hebrews ſay true, as I am not ſo much a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as to manage diſpute on this head of diſcourſe: yet then this only follows, that baptizing the whole body is meant, whereever bathing of the fleſh is mentioned, but not that it is meant other where. And there is mention often enough of cleanſing with waſhing, where yet bathing is not mentioned. Though I am not ſatisfied that bathing doth in the notion of it neceſſarily imply dipping. Again there can be no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from <hi>this</hi> ſort of waſhing, but to waſhings of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſort. But waſhing of Proſelytes for admiſſion into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is another thing from waſhing of Perſons from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions by Iſſues. And this waſhing is of divine Inſtitution: but whether the other were ſo is uncertain. Of this the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution clearly appears in the Word; and ſo it may be better judged of: but of the other there is not the like, if any appearance; and ſo of that we cannot be ſo certain in our judgment. Further, though it were never ſo much
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107492:137"/> as they ſay, yet ſtill is that no obligation unto us, who are under another Diſpenſation, and have Liberties conferred on us by Chriſt, from that <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them by <hi>Moſes, until the times of Reformation.</hi> See <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. of this Treatiſe. Laſtly, I argue thus, If there is to be ſo much ſcrupuloſity in the baptizing of Chriſtians, as the Rabbies ſay there was in the baptizing of <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſame things rendered the baptiſm of the one of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which rendered the baptiſm of the other ineffectual; then it would follow, that though the whole body of a Man were put under water, as the Dippers would have it, yet through the adherency of clay, or ſome other adventitious, perhaps excrementitious, matter to his body, he might ſtill be unbaptized: and we ſhould be as uncertain on that account, when any Perſon were truly baptized, as they are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on account of the Prieſts Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to baptize. If there is not to be that ſcrupuloſity among us, as was amongſt them, then why are their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms in that kind ſo ſcrupulouſly urged upon us? This for <hi>Ainſworth.</hi>

                  <q>To this purpoſe we have Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>ſupport of faith, p.</hi> 54. very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, <hi>viz.</hi> That the eminent thing ſignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Baptiſm, is not ſimply the blood of Chriſt, as it waſheth us from our ſins; but there is a further repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation therein of Chriſt's Death, Burial and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Baptized, being firſt buried under Water, and then riſing out of it; and this is not in a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt, but in a repreſentation of communion with Chriſt in that his Death and Reſurrection: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid (we are buried with him in baptiſm) and wherein we are riſen with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="87">§. 87. That the blood of Chriſt, as it waſheth us from ſin, is repreſented in Baptiſm, is tacitly conſented to by that Doctor in this place: and that it is the eminent thing ſignified, and repreſented in it. But that it is not <hi>ſimply</hi> ſo, (I ſuppoſe he means, that it is not <hi>only</hi> ſo, or that that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107492:137"/> is not <hi>all</hi> the thing which is ſignified, and repreſented in it) but there is a further repreſentation therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the thing, if I underſtand the Doctor, aſſerted by him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I know none will contradict him; provided he make not that, which was the primary deſign of baptiſm, to truckle to other ſecondary deſignations by it.</p>
               <p n="88">§. 88. But here I obſerve the Doctor is not writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Dipping, or Sprinkling, in a way of Diſpute for the one, and againſt the other, nor meddles in the leaſt in thoſe Points, in a way of controverſie: only ſhows how that by the baptized's being firſt buried under Water, and then riſing out of it, (which is a way of ſpeaking familiar to Divines, even thoſe that own and avow the lawfulneſs of ſprinkling) a repreſentation is made of Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection. And no doubt it is ſo, and very eminently, where the Baptiſm is that way adminiſtred. But there is a repreſentation alſo made of theſe things by aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and perfuſion. (as will be further ſhewed in <hi>Ch.</hi> 16.) And therefore there being no oppoſition between what that Doctor aſſerts, and I affirm, I diſmiſs his Teſtimony, as a thing alledged impertinently by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> as to the purpoſe in hand, if it were, as doubtleſs it was, by him deſigned to be excluſive of other ways of baptizing, beſides Dipping. And I conclude, that <hi>by the alteration of this Rite from Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to Sprinkling, the Symbol is not</hi> (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſaith it is) <hi>quite spoiled, nor made any other thing, than the Inſtitutor of it did deſign it; viz.</hi> a Sacrament whereby his waſhing us from our ſins with his blood is repreſented, as the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> deſign of it; and his Death, Burial, and Reſurrection, as the <hi>ſecondary.</hi>

               <p n="1">§. 1. THat <hi>Baptiſm</hi> by other ways than that of a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> and particularly by <hi>pouring,</hi> or <hi>sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling</hi> of water on the baptized, hath been practiſed in the Church, of ancient as well as later times, hath ſufficiently (I hope) been made to appear, by what hath on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject already been delivered in theſe Papers.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may not be unprofitable to make Inquiry into the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> or <hi>Occaſions,</hi> of the Churches gradual decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from the firſt more general way of <hi>dipping,</hi> to that leſs uſual way of <hi>sprinkling,</hi> which yet is now grown to be the more general way.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. And truly I cannot think it proceeded from any wanton humour in the Church, cauſleſly to throw off any <hi>Precept</hi> of Chriſt's, or <hi>Practice</hi> of the Apoſtles. Far be that from being thought of that Company of Men, who are <hi>called to be Saints,</hi> and who know themſelves to be no further ſuch, than they keep both to <hi>his</hi> Precepts, and to <hi>their</hi> Practice, in things wherein their conformity thereunto is indiſpenſably required. What ſhall we think then in the caſe? This, as I humbly conceive; and no more but this: That when the Church ſaw, that there was nothing in the <hi>Precept of Christ,</hi> nothing in the <hi>Practice of the Apoſtles,</hi> whereby it was bound up into ſo ſtrait a room, as to be confined in all, even the greateſt caſes of neceſſity to <hi>one way of baptizing,</hi> and particularly to that of a <hi>total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion,</hi> it made uſe of that power about the <hi>Rituals</hi> of Religion, and <hi>Circumstantials</hi> of Worſhip, wherewith Chriſt, as his Truſtee on Earth, after his departure to Heaven, for the managing of the affairs of his Kingdom

               </p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. How far the Church was from being enforced by any indiſpenſable Precept of Chriſt's, to keep ſolely to the way of a <hi>total immerſion,</hi> has been ſhewn (and, I would fain hope, ſufficiently) in the foregoing Papers. And, if nothing elſe had been ſaid, to any modeſt Inquirer this, methinks, might be ſufficient to perſwade, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intended only a <hi>preſcription</hi> of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Ceremony, that Men <hi>ſhould</hi> be <hi>baptized,</hi> and not a <hi>deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of the <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of it, or manner <hi>how</hi> they ſhould be baptized, in that, whereas he knew there were in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> diverſe <hi>waſhings</hi> called <hi>baptiſms,</hi> ſome <hi>total</hi> of all the Body; ſome partial, only of the <hi>hands,</hi> &amp;c. having in a general term preſcribed the <hi>matter,</hi> he adds not one ſyllable to determine the <hi>manner;</hi> neither ſaying, baptizing their <hi>Heads;</hi> nor baptizing their <hi>Hands,</hi> nor baptizing their <hi>whole Bodies;</hi> neither <hi>sprinkling</hi> them with water; nor <hi>dipping</hi> them into water; nor <hi>pouring</hi> water upon them, nor particularizing any manner of way how he would have the <hi>application of water</hi> made to them: and conſequently that the Church keeping to the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> was by him left at liberty to determine her ſelf as to the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,</hi> baptizing this, that, or the other way, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from conveniency, expedience, or <hi>neceſſity</hi> ſhould perſwade.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:107492:139"/>§. 4. And that ſhe was not bound up to a <hi>total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> by the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Apoſtles, it ſufficiently appears from this, that whereas there are ſeveral Inſtances of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms by the Apoſtles, which with great probability may be preſumed to have been performed by <hi>sprinkling,</hi> or <hi>pouring of water</hi> on the baptized, no one example can be produced of any one Apoſtles baptizing any, which carries with it any more than a probability of its being performed by <hi>dipping;</hi> of no one of them, by what is expreſſed in the Text, can it certainly be ſaid, that it was a <hi>total immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> So then there being but probability againſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and no infallible certainty on either ſide, what could the Church think other, or what other can any Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Church ſhould think, but that in ſuch caſe ſhe had power to determine her ſelf to one way, or to be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to uſe both, or neither, according to her diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. But methinks I hear ſuch a Thunder in mine Ears about <hi>Philip</hi>'s baptizing the <hi>Eunuch, (Act.</hi> 8.38.) that I am not able to get any further, before I ſay ſomething to it. Well then, let us calmly conſider the Caſe. <hi>Philip</hi> having converted the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by preaching unto him <hi>Jeſus, as they went on their way,</hi> (v. 36.) <hi>they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch ſaid, See here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip</hi> hereupon conſenting to it, upon his further profeſſion of <hi>faith in Jeſus Christ,</hi> (v. 37.) <hi>He commanded the Chariot to stand ſtill: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him.</hi> This is the caſe. Now what is here, that neceſſarily infers a <hi>total immerſion?</hi> The <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid, <hi>Here is water.</hi> True: but he doth not ſay, how much of the water there was. <hi>Here is water,</hi> he ſaith; that's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but he doth not ſay, here is a <hi>River,</hi> here is a <hi>Pool,</hi> here's water enough for me to be dipped into. It is ſaid, <hi>John was baptizing in Aenon, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> But here the <hi>muchneſs,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) or quantity of the water is not by the <hi>Eunuch</hi> inſiſted on, as
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107492:139"/> any reaſon why he ſhould here be baptized. He doth not ſay, here <hi>is much water,</hi> but only <hi>here is water</hi> (without <hi>much:) what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> which fairly intimates unto us, that where there is water, be it much or little, there a baptiſm may be.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. But it is ſaid, that both <hi>Philip and the Eunuch went into the water.</hi> Now ſure that they might do, though the water were far from being ſo much, as to be capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a mans <hi>whole body</hi> into it, ſo <hi>to be baptized</hi> in it, as the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, <hi>ſitting,</hi> or rather <hi>ſtanding</hi> up to the neck in it. He that goes into the water but up to the knees, as truly goes into it, as he that goes up to the breaſts. Their going into it then enforces not the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs</hi> being wholly dipped in it.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And then no more does their <hi>coming out of it.</hi> For cannot a man be ſaid to come out of the water, unleſs he have been firſt all, over head and ears, in it? He that is in the water but up to the <hi>ancles,</hi> as truly, when he leaves it, comes out of it, as he that goes into it up to the neck.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. Yea, but it is not barely ſaid, they came out of it, but they <hi>came up out of it.</hi> Well then: if <hi>coming up</hi> out of the water ſignifies a having firſt been all in it, then it ſeems <hi>Philip</hi> was dipped too, as well as the <hi>Eunuch:</hi> for it is not ſaid of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſingly, that he came up out of the water, but of him and <hi>Philip</hi> joyntly, that <hi>they</hi> (that is they <hi>both</hi>) came up out of the water. If then no <hi>total dipping</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> follows upon his coming up out of the water (a thing never pretended by any, and unimaginable in it ſelf) there follows none from the numerically ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> coming up out of it. No more being ſaid of him than of <hi>Philip,</hi> but the ſelf and ſame of both.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. Yea, but it is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> they <hi>aſcended out of the water.</hi> Yes, juſt as it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they <hi>deſcended</hi> into the water. The Objection is too trifling to deſerve a ſerious anſwer. How can there be a going into the water, eſpecially ſuch a one as this is
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107492:140"/> ſuppoſed to be, a water in, or by the high way, without going down into it? where lie confluences of waters, but in low places, which muſt be gone down to by thoſe that will go into them? where is there ſuch a water, though on the top of the hill, that is not lower at the bottom of it, than the earth that bounds it, ſo that there can be no going into it, but there muſt be a going down to it? <hi>Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> then, or going down unto it, or even into it, does not neceſſarily ſuppoſe a going ſo far into it, as till one be over head and ears in it. No more than doth <hi>aſcending,</hi> or coming up out of it. One may well enough aſcend, or come up out of the water, who has been no further than knee deep in the water.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. But ſtill it is ſaid of the Eunuch, that being in the water <hi>Philip</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>baptized</hi> him. Yes, and that he might well enough do without a <hi>total dipping</hi> of him. He might ſprinkle water in his face, <hi>pour water</hi> upon his head, waſh him with <hi>taking water</hi> by <hi>handfuls</hi> and caſting it upon his body, or rubbing him therewith, or might dip <hi>his</hi> head, and no more of him, into it; and yet ſtill here was a baptizing, though no total immerſion of him. Here's nothing then but the mere force of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to perſwade to it. And then any other Text of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Apoſtle is ſaid to have baptized any, might to as much purpoſe be alledged as this Text, that there is ſuch a ſtir about. Now to go about to go to confute the Inference drawn from the ſignification of the word is needleſs here: for that were but to ſay over again all that hath already been ſaid on that ſubject, which I hope the Reader bears in mind: and therefore I ſhall neither trouble my ſelf nor him with it: but leave it to him to judge of it.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. And yet again, that this Baptiſm was by <hi>Conſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or <hi>affuſion,</hi> rather than <hi>immerſion</hi> (unleſs of the <hi>head,</hi> or face only) may ſeem probable. Becauſe, Firſt, there is no mention of their putting off their clothes, when they went into the water; which indeed it was but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107492:140"/> as the caſe ſtood with them, that they ſhould keep on, unleſs they meant to catch their deaths, the ſeaſon being ſuppoſed to be in Winter, not long after the ſtoning of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and they in a journey upon the high-way, where they could have no fire to warm them, after their coming up almoſt ſtarved with going naked into the cold water; and unneceſſary they ſhould put off, being the buſineſs might be done without it, by going but only with their legs bare into the Water. Secondly the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> being (as I ſuppoſe) a Black Moor, may be well thought to be unwilling to be wholly ſtripped naked before St. <hi>Philip,</hi> who was a <hi>White.</hi> Thirdly, there is no mention of the manner of <hi>Philips</hi> baptizing him expreſſed, that enforces to think it otherwiſe, it being not ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he dipped him into the water, but only that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he baptized him, which might be as well, (nay more conveniently, as circumſtances might be) by <hi>conſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> as by <hi>immerſion.</hi> And fourthly, I can find no water in the way, that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> travelled in, fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a Jewiſh <hi>total immerſion,</hi> but a Brook in a Vally, or a Spring bubling up at the foot of a hill to do it in:<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Caves</hi> Life of St. <hi>Philip</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, Sect. <hi>11.</hi> pag. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> neither of which probably were deep enough for it; and the rather becauſe it is not ſaid, that he dipped him into it.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But ſuppoſe it probable, notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid, that his Baptiſm was by <hi>dipping:</hi> yet probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is no certainty, and ſo can afford no demonſtration. And if it be but probable that it was ſo, then it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (nay I have ſhewn ſomething of a probability) that it was not ſo. And then what's all the noiſe of <hi>Philips dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> the <hi>Eunuch</hi> come to? To nothing elſe but mere noiſe. And I wiſh that they who uſe that Argument, would weigh it better before they uſe it again, to confront therewith the Authority and Practice of the Church, when ſhe makes uſe of that Liberty and Power, wherewith Chriſt, the Head of his Church, hath inveſted her; and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107492:141"/> ordereth, or practiſeth baptiſm any other way, than by a total immerſion.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. I might add after all this, that had all things been here as their hearts could wiſh, yet ſtill this had been no example of any Apoſtle. For it was but <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> not <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that baptized the Eunuch. An Apoſtolical perſon, or, if ye will, an Apoſtle, in the larger ſenſe (as <hi>Clemens, Ignatius,</hi> or any other of the Primitive Fathers are called Apoſtles) he was: but no Apoſtle in the ſtrict ſenſe we now ſpeak of, as deſigning by that Appellation only thoſe Eleven Perſons, who were by our Saviour, juſt at his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> ſent by him (and from his ſending them called <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) into all Nations, to make Diſciples all the world over, by teaching and baptizing them, with <hi>Matthias,</hi> after, by divine appointment, elected to take part of that Miniſtery and Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. And had he been never ſo much an Apoſtle, yet ſtill that could only have warranted the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> not enforced a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it. Unleſs one could have been ſure, both that no Apoſtle baptized any other way, and that they all decreed, that their example ſhould in that particular, be binding to all poſterity; or that all, or any one of them, had by a peremptory irreverſible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from heaven declared, that none ever ſhould be baptized any other way. But who can be aſſured of the <hi>firſt,</hi> that has not been made privy to all the actings of all the Apoſtles in that kind, in all places whereever they went and planted Churches? And who can be aſſured of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> who has not heard or read all, that they all ever decreed, preach'd or writ? or has not an infallible aſſurance (which no mortal man can have,) that neither all of them, nor any one of them, ever decreed, writ, or preach'd, any thing, to the contrary?</p>
               <p n="15">§. 15. And ſo now, upon ſerious conſideration, I refer it to the moſt prejudicate Reader to ſay, what enforcement can lie upon the Church from <hi>Philips</hi> baptizing the Eunuch, to neceſſitate her to the dipping of all ſhe baptizes.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107492:141"/>§. 16. And now the Church being ſuppoſed at liberty, for any thing either in the Precept of Chriſt, or Practice of his Apoſtles, to uſe what way ſhe pleaſed in baptizing, I will purſue my intended courſe of ſhewing, on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſhe firſt more <hi>ſparingly permitted,</hi> and after more <hi>freely admitted,</hi> baptizing by way of <hi>Sprinkling.</hi>

                  </note> how little account ſoever any may make of it in this, was held <hi>neceſſary</hi> in order to ſalvation. No coming for any into the Kindom of heaven, that might have baptiſm, and deſpiſed it, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it, was believed then. Yea ſome in proceſs of time went ſo far (perhaps too far) as to hold, not as the Church now holds, a neceſſity in the ordinary way, without tying God to the means, but an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it (ſo as that the ſalvation even of <hi>Infants,</hi> who could neither ſeek it, nor deſire it, nor deſpiſe it, nor neglect it, if they died <hi>unbaptized,</hi> was by ſome doubted, diſputed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed) unleſs that defect were ſupplied <hi>baptiſmo ſanguinis,</hi> with the bloody Baptiſm of <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> How rightly this was believed and held, is not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107492:142"/> my preſent concern to enquire, much leſs to determine. Sufficient it is to my preſent purpoſe, that it was (as I think none, that has had any inſight into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but will ſay that it was) ſo believed and held.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Yet this notwithſtanding, it is evident, beyond all poſſibility of diſpute, or doubt, that many in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times who did believe this, did, for all that belief, defer their baptiſm, not only till their <hi>old age,</hi> but to their <hi>death-beds,</hi> or what they thought might be ſo. Their reaſons why they did ſo are not one, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Preface to Mod. Plea for Inf. Bapt.</note> as I have abundantly elſewhere declared. It may be ſufficient to note here three or four of them. Some did it out of <hi>lothneſs to part with the world,</hi> and their <hi>ſins,</hi> and their <hi>pleaſures,</hi> as thinking that, if once they took the Yoke of Chriſt upon them, they muſt thenceforth renounce, not the devil only, and all his works, but alſo the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh; aſſuring themſelves, that, though they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pleaſures of ſin for never ſo long a ſeaſon, yet if they could but get to be <hi>baptized</hi> at laſt, though it were never ſo late firſt, (not till they were upon their death-bed, and at the laſt gaſp) all their ſins paſt ſhould be forgiven them.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Some did it out of an <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> that though they did by baptiſm obtain remiſſion of all forepaſt ſins, though never ſo many and great, yet <hi>if they ſinned after Baptiſm, for ſuch ſins there was no pardon:</hi> and therefore as knowing the multitude of temptations they muſt daily be expoſed to in the world, and their own weakneſs to reſiſt them, to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107492:142"/> prevent endangering the forfeiture of their pardon for what was paſt, and ſecure their preſent peace, and future ſalvation, they would not be baptized, till they thought themſelves to have out-ſail'd all rocks and ſhelves, to be paſt all ſtorms and dangers, to have arrived in the port of happineſs, and to have nothing more to do, but through the gate of death to enter into eternal life.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Some did it <hi>to avoid</hi> the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Perſecution</hi> for religion; ſince, till they were baptized, they could neither by the cunning of the <hi>perſecuting Heathens</hi> be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, nor by the cowardiſe of any perſecuted Chriſtians be betrayed,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> Prim.

                  </note> to be of the Chriſtian Faith: and ſo would not embody themſelves with the Church all their life, though they meant to expire in her boſom at their death; as knowing by her principles and practices, that She did ſympathize with him that was her Head, and would not be willing that any ſhould periſh, but be ready to ſave all thoſe that would not deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and open her Arms to relieve their Souls at the laſt gaſp of their bodies.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Whether upon theſe or any other Reaſons, as there were many, I ſay not; but ſo it was, that the <hi>baptiſm</hi> of very many was <hi>deferred</hi> to the utmoſt extremity; and there was a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> either of baptizing them then, in that condition, or of letting them depart out of this world unbaptized, or venturing it at leaſt.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. What ſhould the Church do in this condition? ſhould ſhe ſtop her ears againſt their cries? ſhut her eyes againſt their tears? harden her heart againſt their prayers, and deny them baptiſm? Where were then her compaſſion to Souls? How ſhould ſhe ſhew herſelf merciful as her heavenly Father is merciful? with what heart could ſhe ſhut any out of Gods Kingdom, that ſought with prayers and tears to be let into it? Why ſhould ſhe let any be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or but dye in danger of damnation, that by her means might be delivered and ſaved? Yea, why ſhould ſhe let any
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107492:143"/> dye in deſpair or diſconſolate, when ſhe was able to open to them a door of hope, and draw out for them a breaſt of conſolation?</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Should ſhe grant them <hi>baptiſm,</hi> but on condition they would be <hi>totally dipped?</hi> Alas! that were either as ill as a denyal, becauſe it would propound a condition they were incapable of performing; or elſe, whilſt the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercy towards their Souls, to be acting cruelty to their bodies; to make ſure of ſending ſome out of this World, who elſe might have lived longer in it: an act ſo like mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo near killing, that it would be hard, amongſt any that were Chriſtians, to find either a hand or a heart, that could do it; much more, amongſt Miniſters, who would never be perſwaded it were either any part of their office, to kill Men for their ſalvation; or any of God's methods, to deſtroy Mens lives, for the preſerving of their Souls.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. What then ſhould ſhe do? What? but take the middle way: neither deny them, nor dip them: but (what would neither endanger Body, nor Soul, neither deſtroy Life, nor endamage Health) baptize them by a gentle <hi>application of water</hi> to them in the way of <hi>Sprinkling.</hi> And this is the way which the Church in the Primitive times did take, and hath perſevered in, on ſuch like occaſions; as hath, I hope, been competently evidenced in theſe Papers.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> The Institution of Christ not violated by <hi>Sprinkling;</hi> and the agreeableneſs of That, with the primary deſign of Baptiſm further manifeſted.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. BUT perhaps it will be ſaid, that for no <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> much leſs <hi>conveniency</hi> of man, ought there to be any alteration of any <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> much leſs ſuch a one as is diſcordant with the deſign for which it was inſtituted. And therefore <hi>Immerſion</hi> being that way of baptizing which Chriſt did inſtitute, that way muſt ſtand, and <hi>Rhantization</hi> muſt fall.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. To this I ſhall anſwer by degrees. And firſt by way of Conceſſion, I ſay, that ſuppoſing <hi>Immerſion</hi> to be a <hi>way</hi> of baptizing of <hi>Chriſts inſtitution,</hi> yet is it but a <hi>way:</hi> it is not <hi>the way;</hi> it is <hi>one</hi> way, not <hi>the only</hi> way, that he did inſtitute. For indeed to ſpeak <hi>properly,</hi> he did inſtitute <hi>baptization,</hi> the thing it ſelf: but neither <hi>immerſion,</hi> nor <hi>aſperſion,</hi> nor <hi>affuſion,</hi> nor any particular <hi>mode,</hi> or way of baptizing, excluſive as to all others. When he tied us to the <hi>thing,</hi> he left us at liberty as to the <hi>manner,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> a man favourable enough to the way of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, doth declare. And what he aſſerts, I hope, hath been competently vindicated in the foregoing Papers. So that by <hi>aſperſion</hi> or <hi>ſprinkling</hi> there is no violation made of, no alteration made in, Chriſts ſuppoſed Inſtitution: unleſs <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion</hi> were the <hi>one particular</hi> way inſtituted by him, and excluſively to all others, which I think, I have diſproved.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. But Secondly ſuppoſing, yet not granting, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that can be demanded, or deſired, that Chriſt did <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute dipping</hi> to be the particular way of baptizing; yet is that Inſtitution but a <hi>Ritual</hi> one, of a <hi>Ceremonial Action,</hi> not of a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty. And ſure no man will ſay, but that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107492:147"/> Rites inſtituted by God <hi>have</hi> given (and then why may they not again give) place to the neceſſities of man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his offence; who, ſo the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of his Inſtitutions be obſerved, is not rigorouſly exacting in the <hi>Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> thereof, (eſpecially now in the time of the Goſpel) provided there be no diſdainful <hi>contempt,</hi> nor <hi>wilful neglect</hi> obſervable in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. we find <hi>Circumciſion</hi> inſtituted, and as a Covenant, and that an everlaſting one, betwixt God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed after him, and that under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalty of exciſion of the Party, in whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was not obſerved, from off his People. <hi>And God ſaid unto Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations. This is my Covenant, which ye ſhall keep, between me and you, and thy Seed after thee; every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> v. 9, 10. <hi>And he that is eight days old ſhall be circumciſed among you, every man-child in your Generations</hi> —v. 12. <hi>And the uncircumciſed man-child, whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his People: he hath broken my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> v. 14. Here is a Rite ſtrictly inſtituted, as any can be imagined. And yet this Rite inſtituted with ſo much ſtrictneſs by God, gave way to the neceſſity, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, of Man. For it was not obſerved for <hi>forty years</hi> together, all the while that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, till they were paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and come into <hi>Canaan:</hi> and that without any ſignification of God's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that they ſhould omit it, or of his diſpleaſure for the omiſſion of it. They were in travel, and ſurrounded with enemies; they were uncertain in their motions; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed unto on-ſets: and in ſuch caſe the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that Rite could not but be highly inconvenient for them, and thereupon it was for the preſent laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and not reſumed till they had ſet foot upon, and taken poſſeſſion of, the promiſed Land. <hi>Joſuah</hi> 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107492:148"/>§. 5. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.5. order is given for making of <hi>twelve Cakes,</hi> which were to ſtand before the Lord from Sabbath to Sabbath, and then to be <hi>Aaron's and his Sons,</hi> and to be <hi>eaten by them</hi> in the moſt holy place, and as a thing moſt holy unto the Lord, and to be obſerved by a perpetual Statute. So, here is a poſitive Rite inſtituted, by which the <hi>Shewbread</hi> was to be the Prieſts for ever, and to be eaten by none elſe. Well, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his flight from <hi>Saul</hi> comes hungry with his Men to <hi>Nob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.3, 4, 5, 6.</note> deſires ſome Bread of <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prieſt. He tells him he had none under his hand but <hi>hallowed Bread. David</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and takes, and eats of that Bread, which it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawful for him, nor his to eat, but only for the Prieſts, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3, 4. And yet neither then, nor after, is any thing charged upon <hi>David</hi> for this; no guilt is laid at his door for ſuch a violation of God's inſtitution. Nay our Saviour alledges this very example of <hi>David</hi>'s, to juſtifie his own Diſciples againſt a charge brought againſt them by the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Which he had not done, had <hi>David</hi> been criminous in the caſe; and they would not have failed to have replyed upon him for it. A plain caſe that that <hi>Ritual</hi> Inſtitution of God's, did give place to the Neceſſity of <hi>David</hi> and his Men; and that God would rather that ſuch a <hi>Ritual Inſtitution,</hi> though his own, ſhould be unobſerved, than that his Creatures in their neceſſities ſhould be unprovided.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. The obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was moſt ſtrictly injoyned, as moſt holy to the Lord; and whoſoever did any work thereon was ſurely to be put to death: and this obſervation was to be ſucceſſive throughout their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a perpetual Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. And yet this ſo ſevere an Inſtitution of God's gave place to the neceſſities of Man. The work of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> (which was laborious enough) not excepted in the Inſtitution, which forbids all manner of work without exception, was to be done on the Sabbath days. The Prieſts
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107492:148"/> therefore ſatisfied in conſcience touching the lawfulneſs of <hi>doing their Office,</hi> though conſiſting in never ſo laborious an employment, on that day, by the neceſſity there was for it, notwithſtanding that ſtrictneſs of the Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to the contrary, go about their buſineſs, and are neither blamed by GOD, nor Man. <hi>Have ye not read in the Law</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) to the <hi>Phariſees;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 12 5.</note> 
                  <hi>how that on the Sabbath days the Prieſts in the Temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameleſs?</hi> What they did, as being contrary to the <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> was a profanation; but as being done upon neceſſity, (becauſe otherwiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God requiſite on the day could not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) ſo it was free from blame. And this our Saviour urged in juſtification of his Diſciples, accuſed by the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> for doing that which was not lawful on the Sabbath day, namely <hi>plucking ears of corn,</hi> and eating of them: in which action, though in it ſelf repugnant to the Divine Inſtitution, yet becauſe done for a ſupply of their preſent neceſſity, he pronounces them guiltleſs, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Yea how often doth he convince them, even by their own practice, of this truth of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> giving way to the neceſſity,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.10. Luke 14.5.</note> not only of Man, but even of Beaſts, Sheep, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Aſſes, of which, if any fell in a Ditch on the Sabbath day, they would, for all the divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sabbath's Inſtitution, not fail to pluck it out, and were not blamed therein. Nor indeed could they, as acting therein but according to the will of God, and that plainly declared by his Prophet, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.7.) though they underſtood not that paſſage in him, and are therefore bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>to go and learn what it meant,</hi> (Matth. 9.13.) namely that ſaying of God, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> Wherein God declares his preferring acts of Mercy, and Charity, before the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> even of his own <hi>Ritual Laws,</hi> and likes the exhibiting of mercy towards them that ſtand in need of it, better than the offering of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107492:149"/> richeſt Sacrifices to himſelf. Which if they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, our Saviour argues thence in the behalf of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they would rather have made a fair conſtruction of that action of theirs, in plucking the <hi>ears of corn</hi> to eat for the ſatisfaction of their preſent hunger, which their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity rendered juſtifiable, than under pretence of zeal to the Sabbath, have ſo falſly charged the Innocent. And as a determination of the queſtion for the future in all ſuch caſes of mercy or neceſſity, he tells them (<hi>Mark</hi> 2.27.) that <hi>the Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath:</hi> intimating thereby, that the Ritual obſervation of that Day was to give place, when the real neceſſity of Man ſtood in competition with it.</p>

And now the caſe having been thus under the Laws of God before Chriſt's coming, and the deviation from thoſe Laws on grounds of mercy and neceſſity juſtified by our Saviour when he was come; Can it be thought it is otherwiſe now, under the <hi>Evangelical Oeconomy?</hi> or that he more ſeverely ſtands upon the rigid obſervation of his own <hi>Ritual Inſtitutions,</hi> than he did of his Fathers <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Laws?</hi> Did he become a curſe for us, to redeem us from the curſe of the Law, even for non-obſervance of ſuch things, to bring us under a curſe of the Goſpel, for non-obſervance of the like things? The Goſpel has no ſuch curſe in it. And who can think that he, that would have his Sabbath broke, rather than a Beaſt ſhould periſh in a Ditch, would rather have a Soul periſh for want of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than not have it dipped, when baptized?

As firſt that they were ordered to eat it in all the circumſtances of <hi>Travellers</hi> in haſte upon a journey, with their loins girded, ſhooes on their feet, ſtaves in their hands, and expreſly to eat it in haſte. Now men in that condition do not uſe to ſit, but ſtand, at their victuals, and have a kind of Proverb, which they uſe in the caſe, <hi>viz. Whilſt we ſtand we ſtay not.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Philo</hi> affirms them to have eaten ſtanding. Nevertheleſs (ſaith that forenamed Author) it is well known, that when they were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to ſetled habitations, they are it <hi>ſitting,</hi> or <hi>lying,</hi> according to the uſual cuſtom of feaſting in thoſe Countries. And this change continued all along till the times of our Saviour, without any reproof from God; and our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conforms to them herein,<note place="margin">Chriſtus enim &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoli non ſtantes. ſed <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbentes,</hi> in ſignum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etis quam habebant, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt. <hi>Jun.</hi> &amp; <hi>Piſc.</hi> ap. <hi>Poli</hi> Synopſin in loc.</note> and in the ſame poſture eats the Paſſeover with his Diſciples.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107492:150"/> haſte in which they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they in the change aforeſaid inſtituted a Ceremony, which was ſymbolical too, but quite of another matter, namely of the <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> God had now given them in the good Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And all this alteration made upon prudential conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the reaſon of the thing, without any warrant from God for their direction, or check for the change.</p>

Muſt no conſideration be had of Countries and Places? no reſpect to Times and Seaſons? no regard to Perſons and Conditions? but your Opinion and Practice be made a Rule and a Meaſure univerſally to all, and in ſpite of all, not only inconveniencies, but even incapacities, and neceſſities too? And muſt all the Churches in the world, and all the Chriſtians in the world, that conſent not to, and concurr not with you therein, be unchurched and unchriſtned too for this? Is this cauſe enough for you to ſeparate your ſelves from the acknowledgedly beſt reformed Church upon earth? Conſider, I beſeech you, your ways, with the ſad conſequents of them.</p>

               <p n="6">§. 6. Again, how great is the Miſchief that your <hi>Schiſm</hi> either hath actually attending on it, or hath a natural tendency unto, and which, without the intervention of a divine providence, is likely to be conſequent unto it. You cut your ſelves off from Union with the Church, and from thoſe bleſſed advantages of its prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107492:157"/> and from all thoſe ſalvifick influences, which from the Head are by orderly communication derived to all Members in union with it. You out your ſelves of its protection; and all aſſiſtances, that as Members of the ſame Body with it, you might not only in charity expect, but in juſtice claim from it. And you expoſe your ſelves to infinite Temptations to forſake the Truth, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Error. 'Tis ſeldom known but that thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in <hi>Schiſm,</hi> do end in <hi>Hereſie.</hi> And your <hi>Socinian</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren might give you a ſad document hereof, if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. And 'twere well for the Church that the Miſchief went no further than ſo. But, Gangrene like, the Sore ſpreads. You are impatient of being what you are only amongſt your ſelves: but are reſtleſs to bring in others to your party; and have your Emiſſaries abroad whom you ſend out, by preaching and diſputing to bring in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felytes; and ſo involve them in the ſame guilts, deprive them of the ſame advantages, and expoſe them to the ſame Temptations with your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. And yet the Miſchief ſtays not here, but extends it ſelf to a <hi>greater latitude.</hi> Your <hi>Schiſm,</hi> like other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in Chriſtianity, diſparages the Chriſtian Religion, as a way unable to give any ſolid bottom whereon to fix: ſince the Profeſſors of it are not at unity amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but ſlit into infinite Diviſions and Parties, ſo that <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> are ſcandalized at it, and on that account refuſe to embrace it. It diſcredits particularly the <hi>Engliſh Churches Reformation</hi> as inſufficient, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be new reformed: ſo that all turnings from <hi>Popery</hi> are to no purpoſe, without ſtill more turning, even till they come at <hi>Anabaptiſtry:</hi> where yet we ſee there is no ſtay; but a further <hi>turning still,</hi> even from thence to <hi>Quakery,</hi> and thence round to <hi>Popery</hi> again. It weakens the Reformed Intereſt, and expoſes it to be made a Prey to the <hi>Popiſh Faction,</hi> opening another Gap for that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107492:157"/> and Politick Enemy to break in at: who when he comes, as he will be ſo <hi>strong,</hi> as to bear down all before him, ſo he will be ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> as to leave none to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him. And as ye will not ſtand, if we fall; ſo will ye not eſcape, if we be deſtroyed, but <hi>blaze</hi> in the ſame fires, that <hi>burn</hi> us. To inſiſt no further on this Head of Diſcourſe, it tends to the ruine of the Kingdom. For <hi>Schiſms</hi> in the Church are naturally productive of <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the State; (as we have, God knows, ſufficiently learnt by our too late, and too ſad experience hereof!) and <hi>Diviſions</hi> at home are invitations to an <hi>Invaſion</hi> from abroad; and even court its coming. And God grant that neither we, nor you, may ever live to find this verified in the effect of it. If ever it ſhould, the conquering Sword will know no difference betwixt <hi>Guelph</hi> and <hi>Gibeline,</hi> but haraſs, ravage, and ruine all.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. And laſtly, O how little, or rather no cauſe at all have you, by your <hi>Schiſm</hi> to draw, either on your ſelves that Guilt, or on your ſelves and others this Miſchief?</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. If it were demonſtrable that in this Point we were in an Error; yet ſure an Error in a Church ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reformed as ours is, in ſo little a matter, as a ſmall variation in the circumſtance of an Inſtitution, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reaſons of great prudence, high charity, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity, ſhould not be a ſufficient ground for you to make a Separation from its Society and Communion, and turn Schiſmaticks. Would ye conſult Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lect.</hi> 35. <hi>on</hi> Joh. 4.</note> a Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the <hi>darling of Diſſenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he would teach you, that thoſe Aſſemblies, that enjoy the Word and Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though they have many corruptions remaining in them, are to be acknowledged the true Churches of God, and ſuch as none of the Faithful may make Separation from. And he would prove what he taught by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107492:158"/> of our Saviour himſelf communicating with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the then ſervice of God, notwithſtanding all the corruptions that then were both in the Prieſts, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. But much leſs is it ſo, when it is ſo far from being demonſtrable that we are in an Error, that it is rather demonſtrable that we are in the Truth. Poor I, not worthy to be a hewer of Wood, or a drawer of Water for the Sanctuary of my God, with my weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſcanty Reading, ſhort Memory and few Books, little Health and leſs leiſure, have in theſe Papers made it diſputable at leaſt, whether we be in any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or no: if I have not ſolidly prov'd it, that we are in none. Another, probably, that were furniſhed in better meaſure with thoſe things that I want, might put it beyond diſpute. And who now, that were wiſe, would run themſelves upon ſuch a dangerous Rock as <hi>Schiſm</hi> is, in a Point of ſo nice and thin a ſpeculation as this? (but the <hi>mode</hi> of applying the <hi>Baptiſmal water</hi>) and when ſo much may be ſaid on the adverſe ſide, as may on this.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. But leaſt of all is it ſo, when, be we never ſo much in an Error, you are not obliged to communicate with us in our Error. For however erroneouſly we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize our own People, you are not tyed up by us to that way of baptizing. Whoe're of you wants baptiſm for himſelf, or for any of his, may have it performed among us by <hi>Dipping.</hi> And I do believe, that never any, who deſired, was denyed to be ſo baptized, by any Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. Wherefore, ſince ye were initiated into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity among us, and were of us, before ye went out from us, I will ſay to you, as Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> a Man ſometime of great eſteem among the Men of your way, ſaid to ſome that forſook the Communion of this Church
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107492:158"/> in his time, <hi>Redite ad Eccleſiam, qua vos genuit &amp; aluit, Return to the Church that bred and brought you up:</hi> and do not obſtinately continue in that pernicious way of Separation from it. If ye muſt be ſeparating, let it be from the company of Schiſmatical Congregations: and joyn your ſelves to the Society of Catholick Chriſtians. Help to heal the breach you have made in the Church, by returning to Unity with that Society from whoſe community ye brake off; and ſtrengthen thoſe Hands by your Conjunction, which ye have weakened by your Separation.</p>
               <p n="14">§. 14. I ſhall conclude with a good wiſh, to, and for you. God grant you a right underſtanding in this, and all other concerns of Chriſtianity; and eſpecially in thoſe wherein you diſſent from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> that ſo you may, with full Conviction of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a clear Satisfaction of Conſcience, Re-unite with it again. To this, I think, all Lovers of Truth, and Peace, will ſay, <hi>Amen:</hi> and Lord Jeſus, ſay thou <hi>Amen</hi> to it alſo. <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
